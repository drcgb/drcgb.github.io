2,Quantitative,,Catfishing Age? The Influence of Beauty Enhancements on Perceived Age Estimations in Humans and AI,"Age verification has taken an innovative turn with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on online platforms. Face manipulation techniques, such as makeup, can alters one’s perceived age. Limited research has identified that humans and AI perform somewhat similarly when estimating age. Therefore, determining if these AI programs remain accurate, even with beautifying effects, is essential to establish appropriate usage. This study compares humans and AI’s accuracy when estimating the age of faces with beautifying filters and makeup. 274 human participants and 6 AI programs were shown 30 faces of women who either had makeup, filters or no effect on and were to estimate the age. The results will be analysed by using 2 x 3 repeated-measures ANOVA to compare the different groups. It is anticipated that humans and AI will perform similar in their biases, in that they both will underestimate ages when beautifying modifications are applied. On the contrary, it is hypothesised that humans will perform more accurately than AI with beautifying effects. This is due to the finding that AI systems cannot process accurate age estimations for faces when stimuli they have not been exposed to is added. ",Cognitive Psychology,,
4,Quantitative,,Impact of Inter-Parental Conflict exposure during infancy on preschool children’s social and emotional wellbeing: Evidence from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children,"The present study investigated the association between Inter-Parental Conflict (IPC) and children’s subsequent emotional and social wellbeing at ages 4-5 years old.  It also investigated the differential effects of IPC on the individual subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).  1,053 participants from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) Birth Cohort completed self-report questionnaires focusing on each of these variables.   The hypothesis that there is an association between substantial IPC exposure during infancy and subsequent social and emotional development problems were supported.   The results found participants had 0.75 times higher odds of developing social or emotional problems at ages 4-5 years old, although this effect was only statistically significant for conduct problems.  Inspection of the different components of IPC showed that physical conflict exposure were most strongly associated with externalising problems, specifically conduct problems, OR = 2.32, p = .007, 95% CI [1.26, 4.26], and verbal conflict exposure were most strongly associated with internalising problems, specifically emotional symptoms, OR = 1.28, p = .549, 95% CI [0.57, 2.87].   The study concludes that exposure to substantial conflict during infancy has negative implications on children subsequent social and emotional development.  It also highlights that further research is required to reduce the knowledge gap of the risks associated with conflict and to further determine if there is an impact on conflict preventions.  This research indicated that applying interventions focused on the benefits of constructive conflict resolutions may help reduce the deleterious effects conflict has on children’s development.

5,Quantitative,,Comparing human and AI systems in the age estimation of stranger’s faces across different age groups,"Facial-age estimation is the process by which humans estimate the age of other humans using facial cues. Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs and neural networks are being used to undertake this task, with mixed results. Comparing AI and human age estimation ability has been done previously, but little research exists comparing performance on different age groups, particularly teenagers and children. This study aims to investigate the difference in performance between human participants and AI programs on age estimation of three young age groups (child, teenager, young adult). The sample included 92 participants who were asked to estimate the age of 42 faces consisting of an even split between children, teenagers and adults. 6 different web-based AI programs estimated the age of the same photos. Overall, humans and AI were inaccurate by 3.48 and 3.89 years respectively and both overestimated. Humans were found to be more accurate than AI for Child faces, and no difference was found for Teenage or Adult faces. More research is needed on AI programs commonly used by governments and corporations. ",Cognitive Psychology,,
6,Quantitative,,"Don’t get even, get mad: A comparison of anger versus revenge as responses to a transgression in the context of close relationships","Social connections are highly integral to human relationships, however they can often be threatened by transgressions. Literature has largely focused on revenge as a response to a transgression and its ability to restore various outcomes to the victim. However, there has been a growing interest in anger as an alternative response. The present study therefore aims to explore the differences between anger and response as post-transgression responses on symbolic, interpersonal and intrapersonal outcomes, and to determine whether one will prove more beneficial for both the victim, and their relationship with the offender. While research has suggested that anger is likely to have more positive effects on interpersonal outcomes, it is unclear whether anger and revenge will differ on outcomes of a symbolic or intrapersonal nature. Relationship closeness will additionally be explored as a potential moderating factor. This study follows a 2 x 2 experimental design, in which victim response to the transgression (anger/revenge) and closeness of the relationship with the offender (close/not close) was manipulated, resulting in four total conditions. Participants were randomly allocated to one of the four conditions. It was found that anger as a response had greater positive effects on all outcomes measured, while a close relationship was only predictive of positive effects on interpersonal outcomes. Additionally, it was found that relationship closeness had no moderating effect on the victim’s response. ",Social Psychology,Experimental Psychology,
7,Quantitative,,The Influence of Context on Eye-Gaze Parameters and Emotional Processing in High vs. Low Autistic Trait Individuals,"Differences in facial and emotional processing between autistic and non-autistic controls exist, with research primarily indicating differences in the time spent fixating on the eyes versus the mouth. However, little research applies the neurodiversity framework, where the presence of low to high autistic traits in the general population is acknowledged. Further, past research tends to analyse processing of distinct emotions (e.g. happy, sad, angry), with little focus on neutral faces. An additional area of interest is the effect of prior context on processing of emotional facial stimuli. Little is known about how Pellicano & Burr’s (2012) hypo-priors theory of context could be applied in a social context. As such, the present study sought to investigate differences in processing of neutral facial stimuli on a trait level, acknowledging the presence of autistic traits in the general population. Further, the effects of prior context (i.e. positive, negative, none) on eye-gaze parameters (i.e. fixation duration to facial features), and emotional valence ratings of neutral stimuli were also investigated. Results indicated a main effect of context on emotional valence ratings across both low and high autistic trait participants, suggesting that regardless of trait level, prior context impacted ratings. Additionally, prior context was found to influence eye-gaze parameters in low autistic trait participants only, with fixation levels changing across contexts. The present study provides insight into similarities and differences in facial and emotional processing of high vs. low autistic trait participants, and a novel application of the hypo-priors theory in a social context.

8,Quantitative,,How Well Does AI Compare to Humans When Estimating the Age of Faces from Different Races?,"Age estimation from facial images has gained significant attention due to its need in real-world applications, including finance, security, social media, and gaming. Age estimation involves predicting a person's age based on observable characteristics, traditionally using visual cues like facial features and skin texture. Humans have been performing this task with varying accuracy influenced by factors such as race, known as own-race advantage. AI systems using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques are increasingly being employed. Current literature highlights that while AI has shown substantial progress in age estimation, there remains a notable gap regarding its accuracy across various racial groups, especially when compared to human performance. This study explores whether current AI compares to human accuracy in age estimation across various racial groups. The study employs a mixed-method design, comparing a sample of 138 humans against 7 AI systems in estimating age from facial images of 14 individuals from each racial group: white, black, Asian, and Indian. The study's implications underscore the importance of developing diverse training datasets to enhance AI accuracy and fairness in age estimation, ensuring equitable application across all racial groups. This research contributes to the broader understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations in replicating human perceptual tasks and informs future improvements in AI training methodologies.",Cognitive Psychology,,
9,Quantitative,,"Nihil & Void: Exploring the Relationship Between the Dark Triad, Existential Nihilism, & Resilience","The cultural prominence of existential nihilism—a belief that existence is meaningless and that seeking meaning in life is futile - has increased in recent years. Despite its proliferation online and across media, research in this area remains sparse. The recent development of a reliable measure for existential nihilism provides an opportunity to gain valuable insight into this emerging belief system. This study will empirically investigate the relationships between existential nihilistic beliefs, the Dark Triad personality traits (narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), and resilience. This research aims to deepen our understanding of the personality factors that may facilitate or protect against existential nihilism. Given the theoretical link between existential nihilism and low meaning in life - and the purported link between low meaning in life and negative well-being outcomes - understanding the association between these variables is critical.
This study will utilise a quantitative, cross-sectional survey method to collect data from participants recruited via nihilism-related social media groups. The survey will measure Dark Triad traits using the Dirty Dozen Scale (DD), existential nihilistic beliefs using the Existential Nihilism Scale (ENS), and resilience using the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). The study hypothesises that: (H1) Dark Triad traits will positively correlate with existential nihilistic beliefs, (H2) existential nihilistic beliefs will negatively correlate with resilience, and (H3) resilience will mediate the relationship between Dark Triad traits and existential nihilistic beliefs. Data analysis will include descriptive statistics, factor analysis, regression analyses, and mediation analysis to test these hypotheses.",Personality Psychology,,
10,Meta-Analysis,,Trust and Interpersonal Forgiveness: A Meta-Analysis,"Background: Despite the numerous theoretical and empirical links between trust and forgiveness across the literature, there has been a lack of attention directed towards trust’s role in the interpersonal forgiveness process. Aims: As such, this meta-analysis was conducted to synthesise this research and thus expose the extent to which trust is associated with interpersonal forgiveness across the literature. It further aimed to explore the nature of this relationship through assessing possible moderators of its magnitude. Method: The Scopus, PsychINFO and ProQuest databases were searched, and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools were used to critically appraise included studies. Data was extracted and a pooled meta-analytic correlational effect size with random-effects modelling was calculated. Moderators examined included the methodology, forgiveness measure, transgression severity, offender type and age. Results: Overall, from 18 studies and 5193 participants, a positive, moderate association between trust and interpersonal forgiveness was revealed. Of the moderators investigated, the offender type was the only variable to significantly alter the relationship’s magnitude, whereby it was stronger when the offender was a co-worker than when they were a partner. Conclusion: These findings provide a preliminary insight into trust’s potential prominence within the interpersonal forgiveness process. However, limitations may be influencing these results. Therefore, while future research is vital in order to establish the intricacies of this trust-forgiveness connection, findings from this analysis highlight the potential benefit of integrating trust into interpersonal forgiveness interventions so that ultimately the construct can be harnessed to aid relationship reparation following transgressions.",Social Psychology,,
11,Quantitative,,"Does Generative Artificial Intelligence Generate Burnout? Burnout, Job Strain and GAI Technology Usage
","The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory is that “the undesirable impact of job demands on burnout can be alleviated by job resources…” (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017). One relatively new type of resources available and used by knowledge workers is ‘Artificial Intelligence’-enabled technologies, and specifically generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools (e.g. ChatGPT).
It is, however, unknown to what extent AI technology resources are related to knowledge workers’ experiences of burnout. It is theorised that GAI resources have the potential to provide positive impacts on workers and reduce job demands through the enablement of job autonomy and control (Parker & Grote, 2022). Increased job autonomy is known to be associated with decreased burnout experiences (Demerouti et al., 2001; Matthews et al., 2018). This research aims to identify to what extent there is a relationship between workers’ GAI technology usage and burnout experience, hypothesising their ability to grant workers increased autonomy and reduce their work demands.

13,Quantitative,,High school transition: Do approaches to learning and student-teacher relationship in year 6 influence academic achievement in year 7?,"Research findings have consistently highlighted the role of student approaches to learning and the student-teacher relationship on academic achievement from kindergarten throughout primary school. Less is known about the effect of approaches to learning and student-teacher relationship on learning outcomes after the transition to secondary school. The present study investigates the association between approaches to learning and student-teacher relationship in year 6, and academic achievement in year 7. The study utilises pre-existing data from both the Baby Cohort and Kindergarten Cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (N = 903), which are linked to the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN), as a measure of academic achievement in year 7. Approaches to learning and student-teacher relationship were compared to the NAPLAN sub-domains of reading, writing, spelling, grammar and numeracy. Approaches to learning in year 6 were associated with academic performance in year 7, above and beyond child and family characteristics, only for writing, OR = 2.65, 95% CI [1.69, 4.16], spelling, OR = 2.57, 95% CI [1.39, 4.73], and grammar, OR = 5.89, 95% CI [3.08, 11.26]. Student-teacher relationship in year 6 was not significantly associated with academic achievement in year 7, after adjusting for child and family characteristics. Better support for children’s approaches to learning and their interactions with their teachers may help decrease the risk of school disengagement and academic underperformance reported during the transition to secondary school.

14,Quantitative,,Asymmetry in Belief in a Just World: Item Valence Skews Self-Reported Just-World Beliefs-Other,"Belief in a Just-World (BJW) hypothesises that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get. Through this adaptive model, individuals can understand and navigate the world they live in. Originally, the BJW model was categorized as a unidimensional construct that measured an individual’s belief that people will receive what they deserve. However, later theories expanded this model, with it now reflecting a bi-dimensional relationship known as BJW-Self and BJW-Other. 
BJW-Self reflects an individual’s belief that they get what they deserve based on their actions. This construct is often correlated with individual factors such as mental health and life reflection.  In comparison, BJW-Other reflects an individual’s belief that other people get what they deserve based off that person’s actions. 
The present study seeks to refine these measures by exploring the asymmetry assumption that there is both a positive and negative aspect to the BJW-Other construct. This assumption posits a difference in people's opinions about others getting the rewards they deserve for good actions and the punishments they deserve for bad actions. Only one previous study has explored this assumption, finding that BJW-Self measures show a distinct difference in how rewards and punishments are perceived. Therefore, this study seeks to build upon this assumption and determine if the assumption applies to BJW-Other. The study will achieve this aim by testing correlations with other personality traits that should have distinct correlations with BJW beliefs.

15,Quantitative,,Impact of Aid Reliability on the Cry Wolf Effect in a Mock Security Screening Task,"In the last few decades, automation has increasingly been deployed to assist operators to perform complex tasks that were once solely performed by humans. Despite the potential for automation to improve performance, such systems are not infallible, with the type of error the aid is prone towards committing (i.e., false alarms or misses) leading to qualitatively different effects on human behaviour. False alarms committed by automated aids have been shown to lead to a phenomenon known as the cry-wolf effect, which manifests as a decline or cessation in operator responsiveness to automated alerts, the result of which has serious implications for safety and productivity. As previous research investigating the cry wolf effect has found mixed results, the current study aimed to investigate whether aid reliability contributes to the phenomenon. A sample of 160 first-year undergraduate psychology students recruited from the University of Adelaide took part in an online mock security screening task where they were required to search for a knife in x-ray images of passage baggage. They completed the task unassisted and with assistance from a false alarm- or miss-prone aid that was either 80%- or 95%-reliable. As predicted, evidence of the cry wolf effect was found, where false alarm-prone automation resulted in poorer performance than equally reliable miss-prone automation. Contrary to expectations, however, the reliability of the aid failed to contribute to the effect. Practically, these findings carry important implications for automation design regarding reliability level and threshold setting. ",Applied Psychology,Human Factors,Experimental Psychology
16,Quantitative,,An exploration of the risk and protective characteristics of young people under Youth Justice supervision in South Australia across age and sex and examining implications for predicting recidivism,"The current risk assessment tool used in South Australian (SA) Youth Justice, the Victorian Offender Needs Indicator for Youth (VONIY), aims to identify risk and protective factors associated with re-offending to guide rehabilitation strategies. However, the VONIY has never been validated for use, in terms of predictive validity, in SA therefore, the current study aims to validate the VONIY for use in local contexts to assist in informing intervention efforts. The study seeks to 1) observe the risk and protective profiles of young people under sentenced community supervision in SA, and observe how these profiles vary by sex and age, 2) uncover how these factors differentiate between those who return to sentenced community supervision within 24 months and 3) uncover well these factors predict recidivism?

Data was extracted from SA Youth Justice (2010-2023) and the final sample consists of 756 young people under sentenced supervision. Descriptive and chi-squared analyses identified significant differences in risk and protective profiles across age and sex. Logistic regression models predicted the probability of those returning to YJ, over three models using predictors from the VONIY.

AUROC values ranged from 0.68 to 0.74, indicating moderate discriminative power across the models with predictive validity increasing from model 1 (68%) to model 3 (74%). Significant risk factors included high representation from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds and substance misuse.

This study underscores the importance of tailored interventions based on risk profiles, aiming to reduce recidivism through early intervention whilst enhancing our understanding of risk-levels, informing more personalised and effective rehabilitative strategies.

18,Meta-Synthesis,Meta-Ethnographic Approach,Experiences of Loneliness Among Gay Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-synthesis,"The present systematic review and meta-synthesis examined the experiences of loneliness among gay men. Data were extracted from a sample of 72 qualitative studies with a sum of 773 to 1335 participants (18 studies did not specify the exact number of gay male participants included). This study aimed to explore the experiences of loneliness among gay men to offer insights that can enhance understanding for health professionals and policymakers. Advised by Intersectionality Theory (IT; Hagai & Zurbriggen, 2022), the Minority Stress Model (MSM; Meyer, 2003), and the meta-ethnographic approach (Noblit & Hare, 1999), data analysis generated three categories that impacted gay men’s experiences of loneliness. These categories included: 1) external influences of discrimination, lack of support systems, cultural standards, and geographic location, 2) internal conflicts including internalised homophobia, concealment, and fear of rejection, and 3) coping mechanisms consisting of sex, substance use, social life and connections and embracing solitude. The findings emphasise the external and internal obstacles gay men encounter and how some manage these feelings of loneliness. Crucially, loneliness in not uniformly experienced among all gay men but is mitigated by various social identities. Limitations of the study such as the insufficient depth of data reporting in health studies and implications for future research are provided.",Clinical Psychology,Social Psychology,Health Psychology
19,Quantitative,,"The combined effect of health behaviours, sleep, diet, and physical activity on school engagement for pre-adolescents","School engagement is a facet of cognition underpinned by a theoretical construct with three dimensions: behavioural, emotional, and cognitive engagement. School engagement has received increasing attention as a means of improving academic achievement and well-being and mitigating drop-out rates and delinquent behaviour. Emerging literature has linked individual health behaviours, sleep, diet, and physical activity with improved engagement. More developed research shows that the cumulative effect of multiple health behaviours has a greater impact on academic achievement than any behaviours alone, providing evidence for such an association with school engagement. Moreover, middle childhood is a malleable demographic, largely underrepresented in health literature, whereby school engagement peaks. This study aims to provide new knowledge regarding what combinations of health behaviours have the greatest impact on dimensions of school engagement for pre-adolescents using a large population-based Australian sample of 5th and 6th-grade students. It is hypothesised that individual health behaviours will significantly impact school engagement. It is also hypothesised that sleep, diet, and physical activity will have a cumulative impact on school engagement. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed a bifactor model as the best representation of school engagement. A preliminary correlation analysis, followed by robust linear regressions and stepwise linear regression analyses, was performed to determine the cumulative impact of such behaviours on engagement. The study found that combining diet, sleep, and physical activity significantly impacted school and cognitive engagement. However, not all behaviours impacted emotional and behavioural engagement; most of these effects were weak and negative. This study's results can inform school-based approaches to maintain school engagement and health behaviours for pre-adolescents.",Educational Psychology,Developmental Psychology,Public Health
20,Meta-Analysis,,Global Prevalence of Sleep Disturbance and Insomnia in Spinal Cord Injury or Dysfunction: A Meta-analysis,"Background: Sleep disturbance, including insomnia, is common following a spinal cord injury or dysfunction (SCI/D), however estimating prevalence is hampered due to variations in measurement. Aim: To provide an accurate estimate of the global prevalence of sleep disturbance and insomnia in adults with SCI/D, with consideration of methodological and sample characteristics. Methods: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched up until March 22nd 2024, to identify observational studies with an adult SCI/D sample and validated measure of sleep disturbance or insomnia. Studies were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool and proportions meta-analysed using a random effects model. Moderator analyses examined the role of measurement tool, study design, recruitment source, sampling method, sample size, gender, mean age, and years since SCI/D. Results: Fifteen studies, comprising a pooled sample of 11,137 adults with SCI/D, were included. Internal validity across studies was high. Almost 50% of the sample reported some form of sleep disturbance (95% CI: 33% to 67%). Estimates based on self-report (55%, CI: 45% to 64%) were significantly higher than those based on sleep studies or a clinician-informed diagnosis (23%, CI:13% to 39%; QB (1) = 10.15, p = .001). Conclusion: One in two adults with SCI/D endorse symptoms of poor sleep quality. One in five are diagnosed with insomnia. The findings highlight the importance of routinely assessing sleep quality when evaluating patients with SCI/D. Longitudinal research is needed to further understand the relationship between sleep and other important SCI/D outcomes. Protocol registered on Open Science Framework (###).

21,Quantitative,,The Effects of Facial Hair on Unfamiliar Face Identification Performance in One-to-One and One-to-Many Matching Tasks,"Facial identification is utilised to verify identities in a variety of settings ranging from student IDs to border control. However, the act of unfamiliar face-matching is notoriously difficult and error-prone. Nevertheless, the effects of facial hair on accuracy have yet to be explored in this domain. The aim of the current study was to explore the effects of facial hair and task type on identity perception through the administration of a conventional one-to-one Face-Matching Task (FMT) and a newly proposed one-to-many Facial Array Task (FAT). The FAT, inspired by the card-sorting task, allows the consideration of appearance variability in identity perception through comparison of an array to a target image. 48 participants completed both the FMT and the FAT in a randomised order. Both tasks consisted of three facial hair conditions; ‘bearded’ (faces are bearded), ‘clean-shaven’ (faces are clean-shaven), or ‘mixed’ (both bearded and clean-shaven faces). Results from the FMT demonstrated the greatest performance in the clean-shaven condition and diminished performance in the bearded and mixed conditions. Surprisingly, however, the FAT results reflected congruency effects as performance was greatest in the bearded and clean-shaven conditions and greatly inhibited in the mixed condition. Additionally, we explored correlations in performance between the two tasks. These findings not only suggest that in some cases facial hair inhibits facial identification performance but also suggest that facial hair can be utilised as an identification cue when appearance variability is considered.

22,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Exploring the Experiences of Social Loafing in Group Work Among Online Psychology Students,"Social loafing, defined as the tendency for individuals to exert less effort when working in a group compared to working alone (Karau & Williams, 1993, p. 681), presents significant challenges in online learning environments. These challenges include increased transactional distance (Moore, 2018), difficulties in maintaining engagement, and reduced task visibility (Sagayno et al., 2023), all of which can encourage some group members to contribute less. The lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and reduced accountability among group members, further complicating the group dynamics. Through a qualitative approach, this research explores how online psychology students perceive and experience social loafing during group tasks. Data was collected using semi-structured focus groups, conducted via Zoom, with nine participants from the Graduate Diploma of Psychology program. Reflexive Thematic Analysis was used to understand students’ view on mitigating social loafing, and students’ perceptions of teaching strategies aimed at minimising this behaviour. This research contributes to the existing literature by providing insights into the unique challenges of online group work, and proposing practical strategies to reduce social loafing. By involving students in co-creating solutions, the study informs the development of evidence-based interventions for improving group work in online psychology education.",Educational Psychology,,
23,Meta-Analysis,,Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Depression in Multiple Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Depression is prevalent in people living with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), with no gold-standard treatment recognised for reducing symptoms. Although Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the most examined treatment for depression across the lifespan, its efficacy for pwMS is unclear. Aims: To obtain a pooled estimate of CBT’s effect and investigate potential sample (e.g., baseline depression levels, MS duration) and intervention characteristics (e.g., delivery form, intensity) that may influence its effectiveness. Methods: A systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO databases (no date limits) was conducted on the 13th of March, to identify randomised controlled trials of CBT for depression in pwMS. Included studies were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tool and effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were pooled using random and mixed effects modelling. Results: Thirteen independent studies, involving a combined sample of 909 adults with various forms of MS, were identified. CBT was more effective than waitlist controls and other established treatments (e.g., Supportive therapy) in reducing depression levels (gw = 0.76, CI [0.44, 1.20]). Noted gains had, however, diminished by follow-up (gw = 0.09, CI [-0.09, 0.26], Nstudies = 7). Aside from those newly diagnosed showing greater receptivity to the intervention (Q (1) = 9.11, p < .05), no other treatment moderators were identified. Conclusions: CBT is effective in managing depression symptoms in pwMS. However, more rigorous, controlled studies are needed to examine the potential enduring effect CBT can have on MS-related depression as well as the mechanisms underlying any treatment effects.

24,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Navigating Modern Intimacy: A Qualitative Exploration of the Influence of Hookup Culture on Experiences of Sex and Relationships,"Hookup culture is a complex phenomenon driven by socio-cultural norms and scripts surrounding non-committed sexual encounters. Modern day technology has aided the rise of hookup culture with an increased accessibility to hookup partners found on online dating apps such as Tinder. The current literature mainly uses quantitative methods to examine hookup culture, focusing on the risks and rewards of participation. There is little qualitative research on the topic despite the importance of lived experiences in understanding the complexities of hookup culture. As such, the present study aims to explore how participating in hookup culture influences people’s self-reported experiences of sex and relationships. Qualitative surveys were completed by 41 participants. The data were thematically analysed to find key themes that reflected the experiences of participants. From this analysis, four major themes were generated: Adjusting to Commitment, Realising Self-Worth, Prioritising Connection and Intimacy and Conflicting Sexual Norms. Social Exchange Theory and Sexual Script Theory were used to interpret the results.

25,Meta-Synthesis,,Psychological experiences of spouses or partners of people living with young onset dementia: a qualitative systematic review,"Young onset dementia (YOD) is the term used to describe people living with dementia who experience symptom onset prior to the age of 65 years (van de Veen et al., 2021). In Australia, approximately 28,900 people were reportedly living with YOD in 2023, of which 95% were living within the community (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2024). Most frequently, primary caregivers for those living with YOD are family members, including partners and children (Macdonald et al., 2020). It has been acknowledged that experiences of spouses are unique due to the nature of the partnership (Macdonald et al., 2020). Therefore, the purpose of this review is to explore the psychological experiences of spouses or partners of people living with YOD and use the synthesised findings to provide recommendations for policy and practice. 

Data will be synthesised using a meta-aggregative approach as outlined by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis (Aromataris et al., 2024). Meta-aggregation does not re-interpret the primary author’s findings. A three-step process will be taken to extract findings from all included studies, develop categories for similar findings, then develop synthesised findings. 

The research literature suggests a gap in evidence regarding interventions for spouses of YOD, despite recognition of the psychological impacts, including depression, grief, and loss (Richardson et al., 2016). The synthesised findings of psychological experiences of spouses or partners of people living with YOD will include recommendations for practitioners working with this population to improve psychological wellbeing.

26,Quantitative,,Individual Differences in Deepfake Detection: The Role of Human Face Perception Ability,"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have allowed for the accessibility of tools which are able to generate highly realistic fictitious synthetic faces. This technology has been employed in the spread of misinformation, which is a particular concern in the modern era. Although there have been some investigations into the human ability to discriminate between real or synthetic faces, there has been limited investigations into the mechanisms behind this ability. Furthermore, researchers have not yet explored whether this ability is related to human face perception. To address this important research gap, the present study investigated whether individual face perception abilities, including self-perceived face recognition ability, face matching ability, and face recognition ability, relate to the ability to discriminate between real and synthetic faces. Based on prior literature, it was hypothesised that there would be a negative relationship between self-perceived face recognition ability and synthetic face discrimination ability, a moderate to strong positive relationship between face matching ability and synthetic face discrimination ability, and a small to moderate positive relationship between face recognition ability and synthetic face discrimination ability. Participants were administered an online assessment battery consisting of three predictor tasks: the Stirling Face Recognition Scale, the short Glasgow Face Matching Test 2, and a self-developed face recognition test. The assessment battery also included a self-developed synthetic face discrimination test as the outcome task. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between the performance of the predictor tasks and the outcome task.

27,Quantitative,,In the eye of the beholder: the influence of autistic traits and emotional intensity when categorising emotions,"Faces are one of the most informative stimuli humans will perceive, and individuals engage with the eyes most as they provide numerous amounts of information that help to understand emotional cues. However, facial scanning patterns may differ between people with high and low autistic traits, as characteristics of autism are difficulties and differences in processing social information. Studies have shown that those with high autistic traits have longer reaction times and fixate on different areas of the face when categorising faces. However, more research is needed to understand how we scan faces when the facial expression is more subtle or complex, and whether the eye gaze pattern is different in people with high and low autistic traits. Therefore, this study aims to understand how long and where on the face people with high and low autistic traits look when evaluating the intensity of joy or anger in facial expressions. Using an eye tracker, participants were shown faces that were either positive or negative, with either high or low intensity and responded on a Likert scale (very negative to very positive) to what they thought the face was showing. Participants also completed a survey evaluating their autistic traits and anxiety levels. The results showed that people with high autistic traits had longer reaction times categorising faces compared to those with low autistic traits and, interestingly, fixated on the eyes longer than low autistic traits. The findings from the study may help inform and improve interventions for people with autism.",Cognitive Psychology,,
28,Quantitative,,Examining the Relationship Between Belief Systems and Social Connectedness in Younger Generations,"Younger generations (Gen Z = 18-27 years and millennial = 28-42 years) have been experiencing a decrease in social connectedness since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Social Identity Theory (SIT), religions like Christianity, due to their belief systems promoting strong social identities and group membership, have been found to be strong predictors of social connectedness. However, there has been an increase in younger generations stepping away from traditional belief systems, and alternatively subscribing to belief systems like existential nihilism (believing that existence in meaningless) that do not have the same level of group membership promotion. However, there are mixed results on whether Christianity promotes strong group membership in younger generations and there is no current research on how existential nihilism associates with social connectedness. Using SIT as a guiding framework, the current study explores whether holding either Christian beliefs or existential nihilistic beliefs associate with social connectedness in younger generations. A survey was administered to 511 participants (18-42 years), including a Christian sample (N = 181) and existential nihilistic sample (N = 330). Linear regression models were used to understand the relationship between Christian beliefs or existential nihilistic beliefs and social connectedness. The models find Christian beliefs positively predict social connectedness to a small extent, while existential nihilistic beliefs negatively predict social connectedness to a moderate extent. These findings highlight the need to improve the social identity of existential nihilism to begin seeing positive promotion of social connectedness or invest into other areas that can promote social connection to a similar extent as religious group membership.",Social Psychology,,
29,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Experiences of Loneliness and Preferences for Podcasts: A Qualitative Study on the Perspectives of Midlife Women,"Loneliness has emerged as a global public health priority due to its high prevalence and association with mental health problems, chronic illnesses, and increased mortality rates. Women in midlife, aged 40-65, are particularly vulnerable to loneliness due to age-related life transitions, for example, children leaving home. Although recent studies suggest that podcasts could be an effective tool for alleviating loneliness, limited qualitative evidence exists from the perspective of midlife women. Consequently, this qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of loneliness among midlife women, and their perspectives on and preferences for using podcasts to mitigate loneliness. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight self-selected midlife women from a community centre serving an outer metropolitan area. The transcribed interviews were iteratively analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, underpinned by a critical realist framework. Participants discussed the challenges of recognising loneliness and the impact of stigma on seeking help. Key causes of loneliness included relocating, changes in family dynamics, menopause and caring roles. Barriers to seeking social connection encompassed work and personal responsibilities, as well as a choice to be alone. While some participants identified podcasts as a convenient, accessible, and informative tool that could effectively reduce loneliness, others expressed a preference for music over podcasts, concerns about competition within the podcast market, and issues with audience engagement. Recommendations for a podcast series on loneliness among midlife women were discussed. The application of these findings will support the Australian national network of community centres in their efforts to reduce loneliness among midlife women.

30,Quantitative,,Testing theories of word processing when reading: An electroencephalography study,"A major disagreement in the reading research literature is whether people read words serially or in parallel. Early studies showed that when small numbers of words are presented together for only a brief amount of time, they can affect each other’s processing. This was initially used as evidence that words are processed in parallel. However, serial processing explanations of the same phenomenon have also been offered. Here we used a novel manipulation where the position of a grammatical error in four-word sentences presented quickly (150ms) was manipulated. Parallel processing models predict that the position of the grammatical error should not affect processing, but serial models predict that it should. Processing was measured using event-related potentials from 24 young adults. The results showed that grammatical errors that occur in the first two words of a sentence elicit a less negative going N400 than grammatical errors in the last two words. Since the N400 is related to the extent to which semantic processing occurs, this suggests that the semantics of sentences with an early error are processed less than sentences with a late error. According to a serial processing account, this is because grammatical errors reduce semantic processing after they occur, an effect that is well established in serially presented sentences. Alternatively, a parallel account has no explanation for this, as the position of the error should not affect when it is processed and thus such semantic processing differences should not be found. These results are important because rather than explain how what looks like parallel processing might be done serially, they show direct evidence of a serial effect.",Experimental Psychology,,
31,Meta-Synthesis,,Experiences of People Who Are d/Deaf and Queer: A Systematic Review and Meta-synthesis,"The current systematic review and meta-synthesis investigated the experiences of Deaf and queer people, specifically, how identities in this population shifted dynamically in response to their dual marginalisation. Data was extracted from 27 qualitative studies, with a sample total of 176 participants. The motivating influence for this study was to answer the call for Deaf Studies to be more inclusive, shifting away from a politically homogenous Deaf whole, investigating the nuances and differing experiences of those with dual identities. Synthesis was influenced by the meta-ethnographic approach of Noblit and Hare (1999), and the Model of Multidimensional Identities (MMDI) was imported to frame resulting categories and themes (Jones & McEwen, 2000). Four categories were gleaned from the data: 1) institutional contributors to identity salience, such as audism, religion, and ideas of success, 2) cultural moderators of institutional neglect, with themes of language, lateral violence, and the hearing queer community. 3) Resistance to double exclusion through community, encompassing double exclusion, double acceptance, and romantic relationships. Last, 4) personal navigation of a contested body, including coping strategies, and confidence and acceptance. The findings elucidate a picture of complex discrimination, where identities are largely shaped by preconceived notions of identities, community, and language access. Limitations include the use of queerness as an umbrella label, future directions for research are suggested. Keywords: identity, Deaf, queer, qualitative. ",Cultural Psychology,Social Psychology,
32,Quantitative,,Examining the Role of Beards and Face Masks in Face Matching Performance,"Faces are crucial for identifying individuals, which is important in many social and forensic situations. However, numerous studies show unfamiliar face matching to be error prone and impacted by various factors. Studies have demonstrated the significant negative impact of face masks and disguises on face matching performance, though previous research has not investigated whether natural beards impact performance, and how this may differ to the obstruction of face masks or disguises. Additionally, studies have demonstrated which facial features are useful for matching faces; however, previous research has not investigated how this might be influenced when certain features are obstructed. The current study tested participants on a simultaneous unfamiliar face matching task, to explore the effect of natural beards on performance, and how this compares to fake beards and face masks. All participants were presented with pairs of faces involving four different obstructions of equal trials: cleanshaven, beard, fake beard, face mask. Participants were also required to complete a feature rating task, describing the top 5 facial features used during the face matching task across the four obstruction conditions. Participants’ accuracy was significantly higher in the cleanshaven condition, though accuracy was the same across the beard, fake beard, and mask conditions. Results from the feature rating task showed that different facial features were considered useful across the obstruction conditions. The study demonstrated that beards have a similar negative effect comparable to fake beards and face masks, which has implications for forensic face matching in security settings.

33,Quantitative,,"Exploring the Role of Regret in Decision-making Involving Cryptocurrency Investments
","Cryptocurrency has brought an unprecedented revolution to the financial market, attracting retail investors to include it in their investment portfolios. However, the volatility and uncertainty of this market often lead to investors regretting their decisions. Less is known about how regret and the associated emotional upset affect decision-making in this relatively novel market. Based on 403 cryptocurrency investors, the 2x2x2 factorial study aimed to understand whether the asymmetry of commission and omission regrets observed in other contexts is as pronounced as in cryptocurrency investment and whether these effects vary with temporal distance under social comparison. The study also explored the influences of psychological characteristics on decision-making. As hypothesised, acts of commission led to greater regret and emotional upset, which were associated with more impulsive investment intention in cryptocurrency investment, but no significant effects of temporal distance and social comparison. The study also revealed that at-risk and problem-gambling investors reported a higher intensity of regret than non-gambling investors. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and risk tolerance were related to more impulsive investment intentions, whereas cryptocurrency literacy can mitigate this propensity. The study suggests that cognitive biases, emotional reactions, and psychological characteristics are all relevant to decision-making, and higher crypto-specific literacy can protect investors from making irrational decisions in cryptocurrency investment. The limitations of the study have been discussed. Future research should examine what particularly triggers regret and associated emotional reactions in cryptocurrency investments to tailor strategies for better-regulating regret and associated emotions.

34,Quantitative,,The relationship between current emotions and selective attention,"There is a consensus in the literature about how emotions affect the way we constantly learn and evaluate new information and therefore, influence our attentional and learning processes. However, most of the existing research has focused on manipulating emotions and attention through external visual stimuli, leading to various uncontrolled confounds that produce mixed and inconsistent findings. Moreover, these studies primarily capture the exogenous type of attention, which is mainly associated with perception and automatic visual responses. There is a gap in the literature regarding the interplay between emotions and endogenous attention, which supports learning processes. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate the relationship between emotions, attention, and learning. Current emotions are assessed using an observational task based on Plutchik’s emotion wheel, and attention is manipulated through Le Pelley and McLaren’s (2003) learned predictiveness task. The research hypothesis posits that current emotions may either minimize or magnify the effects of selective attention. The attentional task employs neutral stimuli that can be predictive or non-predictive. This study utilized existing data from a larger project examining the relationship between learning performance and genetics. A community sample of 215 randomly selected participants was tested in a laboratory setting using a customized app on an iPad. Multiple linear regression was employed to predict the learning attention effect based on demographic variables and emotion ratings. The insights gained from this study have implications in the fields of education, developmental psychology, mental health, psychopathology, psychological treatment, assessments, social interactions and decision making.",Cognitive Psychology,Learning & Behaviour,Experimental Psychology
35,Quantitative,,"Predicting Pain Experiences using a Polygenic Risk Score of Neuroticism in Adolescents. Does Pain Catastrophizing and Life Events play a part?

","The role of neuroticism in pain outcomes assumes much significance. Numerous research has found associations of high neuroticism to increases in levels of pain experiences. Despite the progress in research linking neuroticism to pain outcomes, there is lacking research on the interplay between neuroticism, genetic factors, and pain experiences. Thus, the current study aims to use a polygenic approach, by creating a polygenic risk score for neuroticism, and assess its association with pain experiences. Additionally, investigation on how pain catastrophizing and life events interact with neuroticism, as mediator and moderator respectively, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of individual differences in pain experiences. The current study is a secondary data analysis, where data from the CogBIAS study is used. Specifically, the sample size is limited to adolescents with Caucasian ancestry (n= 391), due to generalisation limitations of the polygenic risk score. PROCESS macro models 4 & 7 are used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the variables on pain experiences. The results from this research will improve the understanding of the genetic basis of neuroticism and its influence on pain experiences. Furthermore, by focusing on the interaction of a polygenic risk score of neuroticism and psychosocial factors, we can better predict the efficacy of responses to pain treatment interventions and create more informed future treatment plans that tailor to an individual’s genetic predisposition.

36,Quantitative,,Existential Nihilism and Wellbeing: The role of social support as a moderating factor,"Existential Nihilism is a philosophical position which posits that life is meaningless, without purpose, and any search for meaning in existence is similarly pointless. Despite the deep philosophical and cultural history of existential nihilism, its potential impact on mental health and society remains largely unknown, largely due to a lack of psychometric tools to measure it. This study makes use of the recently developed Existential Nihilism Scale (ENS) to quantify nihilistic belief and investigate its potential relationship with wellbeing. It was hypothesised existential nihilism would be negatively associated with wellbeing. It was further hypothesised that an individual’s social support would moderate this relationship, with higher social support mitigating nihilism’s negative impact on wellbeing. Wellbeing was measured using the PERMA Profiler, and social support was measured using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). An online survey was distributed to University of Adelaide students (N =172) and to members of online nihilism communities on Reddit and Discord (N =750). A multiple regression analysis controlling for demographic variables was conducted to determine the relationship between scores on the ENS and the PERMA profiler. A moderation analysis was also undertaken to investigate whether a person’s perceived social support would moderate this relationship. This research could have implications for understanding how worldviews and philosophies may impact wellbeing and mental health.",Positive Psychology,,
37,Quantitative,,Masculine Gender Role Stress and Hostile Attribution in Alcohol and Non-alcohol Related Contexts,"Hostile attribution is the general tendency to ascribe aggressive or otherwise adverse intent to the ambiguous behaviour of others and is a robust predictor of aggression. Limited research shows that manipulations of masculine gender role stress, where one’s masculinity is briefly threatened, can increase the accessibility of aggressive thoughts and biases. To date, researchers have yet to investigate this effect on attributions of others intent in heterosexual men. Extant literature also supports a causal link between alcohol related cues and increased aggressive cognitions via semantic association. We hypothesised that men following a brief masculine gender role stress induction would demonstrate greater hostile attribution compared to non-threatened men. We predicted that hostile attribution would be greater in alcohol related contexts compared to non-alcohol related contexts, and that we would observe an interaction effect between feedback condition and scenario context. The final sample comprised 173 heterosexual men who were recruited online using Prolific. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two between-subjects feedback conditions that was either threatening or non-threatening to their masculine identity. All participants were exposed to the two within-subjects scenario contexts. Over the course of the study, participants also completed measures of trait anger, conformity to masculine norms, and alcohol consumption behaviours.

Research into student perceptions and motivations has been considerably discounted in the research, but is needed in order to understand the student perspective to further produce ways in improving SET. A total of nine participants were recruited, all of which who were students at the University of Adelaide, to engage in two focus groups on-campus.

39,Quantitative,,Get Mad or Get Even: A Correlational Study Exploring How Anger and Revenge Affect the Self and the Relationship,"Expressing anger in interpersonal relationships can be necessary for maintaining wellbeing, though revenge; while a related construct, tends to be more interpersonally damaging. Limited research exists comparing the effects of anger and revenge specifically on both individuals and their relationships, leaving questions about the utility of each approach and their effect on wellbeing and interpersonal relationships. This study hypothesises that, compared to revenge, anger expression is associated with less overall negative affective and relationship-oriented outcomes, including; justice satisfaction, affect, reconciliation, forgiveness and relationship quality. Additionally; empowerment, moral change and moral criticism differentially mediate the relationship between anger or revenge and justice satisfaction. This correlational study involved an autobiographical recall design with 200 participants recruited online via Prolific. The results provide evidence to support the hypotheses, in particular; how the aforementioned mediators differ in their levels of indirect effect. This study provides a novel area of inquiry in comparing anger and revenge responses and has implications for how people process and understand their responses to hurtful transgressions.",Social Psychology,,
40,Meta-Analysis,,The Impact of Antiepileptic Medication on Cognitive Function in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are a known mechanism of cognitive impairment in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), with serious implications for quality of life. Despite this, unclear reporting of cognitive data, biased comparison groups, and poorly defined cognitive domains are consistent throughout the literature. To date, no meta-analysis has been conducted on the impact AEDs have on cognitive function in TLE patients. Research Questions: (1) Are there quantifiable differences between mono/polytherapy or unmedicated TLE patients in general cognitive functioning, as well as specific areas such as memory, attention, processing speed, executive function, or language? (2) Are sample characteristics (e.g., age of onset or seizure frequency) associated with differences in estimated effect size?

41,Quantitative,,The impact of lower-class speech: Electrophysical correlates of the perception of stereotyped Australian speech,"Accent characteristics of speech to do with linguistic style and prosody influence how a person is understood. We investigated electrophysiological correlates of these. Twenty-five young adults participated. They listened to sentences spoken by two female speakers. One had a General Australian accent (the most common dialect spoken in Australia) and the other had a Broad Australian accent (a dialect often associated with lower socio-economic status groups). Sentences were manipulated at a keyword to either be class stereotyped or class non-stereotyped (e.g., For the Broad Australian accent: When I get home, I like to have a glass of wine (incongruent)/bourbon (congruent)). Event-related potentials displayed a significant prosody by linguistic style interaction in both a N400 and late positive component (LPC) window, where there appeared to be an effect of congruency in the Broad Australian but not General Australian group. However, post-hoc testing was only significant in the LPC window. Further analyses correlating the size of this effect in the Broad Australian group with a self-rated measure of Classism (the Classism Attitudinal Profile Questionnaire) was not significant. These results suggest that stereotyped speech based on accents used by different social classes affects the way people process the meaning of sentences from relatively early in processing, but that the affects can be asymmetrical. In this case, our participants, all of whom had a General Australian accent, did not appear affected by stereotypes that used their own dialect but were by the Broad Australian accent.

Youth and young adults constitute a significant portion of the forklift operator workforce; however, existing training is insufficient to address the acquisition of safety skills essential to reducing avoidable accidents. Using a custom virtual reality (VR) simulation software, the current study aims to assess the efficacy of real-time reinforcement learning in the acquisition of forklift safety skills as a novel intervention for young people (aged 17-25). 
This study used a mixed experimental design with experimental conditions as a between-subjects factor (VR-feedback training condition, paper-based training condition) and test timepoints as repeated measures within-subjects factor (final, retention test). Participants were assigned to the control or experimental condition and over three sessions, undertook 8 training modules and 2 tests (drive test, final test), and a retention test a week later. Repeated measures ANOVAs assessed between-groups variance in task performance and within-groups variance for the final and retention tests. Participants completed the NASA-TLX after each session as a measure of cognitive burden. A repeated measures ANOVA evaluated the between-groups variance for total cognitive load. 
Final results and conclusions pending data collection and analysis. 
The results from this study will provide a preliminary assesment of the efficacy of VR feedback-based training for the delivery of forklift safety skills. This may be implemented as a bridge between traditional paper-based training and operation of a forklift in the ‘real’ environment.

43,Quantitative,,Grief to Belief: Navigating the Existential Landscape After Loss,"An existential nihilist rejects the notion of meaning in life and perceives efforts to seek meaning as futile. Despite the rising popularity of existential nihilism on Reddit, TikTok, and YouTube, a notable gap remains in understanding its effects on wellbeing and illbeing, including factors leading to its development. Hence, this study aims to explore the relationship between nihilistic beliefs and the domains of wellbeing and illbeing in the context of grief. Prolonged Grief Disorder impacts 10% of individuals experiencing grief, characterised by symptoms of intense longing for the deceased, withdrawal from social interactions, and a sense of meaninglessness in life persisting beyond six months following the loss. This study will be informed by constructivism theory which emphasises the human tendency to attribute meaning to life experiences and construct a self-narrative that shapes their self-understanding, emotions, and aspirations. Additionally, grief disrupts this by undermining feelings of security and control over life, and challenging core beliefs. This study utilised a survey design and included validated measures to assess grief (PG-13), nihilism (ENS), wellbeing (PERMA model), and illbeing (K10). Results from power analysis indicated a sample size of 200 required to achieve 80% power, while a sample of 300 needed to achieve over 90% power. The lower power range aligns with conventional power norms, whilst the larger sample size allows for greater statistical power.

44,Quantitative,,Exploring the associations between intellectual humility and bystander attitudes and decision-making processes,"Intellectual humility is a mindset that guides our intellectual conduct. While prior research has demonstrated that intellectual humility is associated with openness, curiosity, tolerance of ambiguity, and low dogmatism, little is known as to how it influences the decision-making process. Consequently, the present study aims to examine how the constructs of intellectual and general humility moderate an already established relationship between the adherence to traditional male role norms and bystander attitudes. Masculinity, and the traditional norms that it encompasses, has been distilled into three distinct dimensions: status, toughness, and antifemininity. Decisional balance refers to how an individual evaluates the pros and cons of intervening in an emergency and has been shown to be a significant indicator of bystander behaviour It is proposed that those who exhibit high levels of intellectual humility have an increased likelihood of intervening in emergency situations. The basis for this is that when such individuals evaluate the pros and cons of a situation, due to their high level of IH they will most likely be aware of a multitude of unknown pros and cons. At this point they may decide that the best course of action therefore is to act on what is known and disregard what is unknown, thus motivating them to intervene. Conversely, the alternative may also be true. Individuals high in IH may be aware that a multitude of unknown pros and cons may exist, and therefore they may feel more information is required prior to acting. This would result in an inhibition of action as they may feel it necessary to acquire more understanding of the situation at hand.  ",Individual Differences,Personality Psychology,Social Psychology

This generation faces increased exposure to technology from a young age, contributing to a rise in cyberbullying. While cyberbullying victimisation has known long-term effects on mental, physical, and social health, as well as academic outcomes, it remains under-researched as a distinct variable in early adolescence. This study examines the relationship between cyberbullying victimisation, learning readiness (perseverance, cognitive engagement, and academic self-concept), and academic achievement in South Australian students. Using longitudinal data, the study analysed the relationship between of cyberbullying victimisation and learning readiness in year 6 and academic achievement in year 7. Simple linear and multiple regressions in SPSS were used, including models with and without covariates. Findings reveal that Year 6 cyberbullying victims had lower scores in learning readiness and subsequent Year 7 numeracy and literacy compared to non-victims. Cyberbullying was significantly associated with these lower scores, even after controlling for covariates. Perseverance in Year 6 emerged as the strongest predictor of Year 7 numeracy (β = .13), while cognitive engagement was not significant. For reading, cyberbullying victimisation in Year 6 was the strongest predictor, with a small negative effect (β = -.09). The study illustrates the negative impact of cyberbullying victimisation on early adolescents, highlighting the need for earlier education and interventions.

The current meta-analysis aimed to compare the loneliness scores of individuals with SCI/D with the general population, using a community sample of people with SCI/D and participants from the Global Touch Test. 

Methods: Studies were identified from Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, APA PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Web of Science as well as Google Scholar and Scopus citation searching. Study quality was assessed using the QualSyst Assessment Criteria. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software (version 4.0.0) and group differences between participants with a SCI/D and healthy controls were operationalised with Hedges g. 

Results: Eleven observational studies, with a pooled sample of 2639 adults with a SCI/D were utilised. The summary effect was small and negative and was not affected by the version of UCLA Loneliness Scale used, mean age and recruitment date. Hedges g did vary depending on sample size. 

Conclusions: Loneliness scores were only marginally lower than the general population, indicating that SCI/D does not lead to elevated levels of loneliness. Future research can build upon this research with studies that administered the UCLA on a SCI/D sample and a normative healthy control group simultaneously, to reduce the impact of the disparity of sample sizes and time at which UCLA was administered between the two groups.

Academic burnout negatively impacts students’ study, motivation, wellbeing and quality of life. Psychology honours students are undertaking a critical year for their career in a highly competitive degree, leading to experiences of increased pressure and psychological distress, increasing their risk of burnout. Burnout is characterised by exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy. This study aimed to explore burnout among psychology honours students. As well as the influence of psychological flexibility and physical activity on burnout and validate the Maslach Burnout Inventory- Student Survey (MBI-SS) within this population. Participants (131 South Australian psychology honours students) completed an online survey, containing the Personalised Psychological Flexibility (PPFI) measure, the MBI-SS measure and a physical activity measure. A correlation analysis displayed a small inverse correlation between psychological flexibility and burnout, which supports current literature. Latent variable structural equation modelling displayed no relationship between physical activity, psychological flexibility and burnout. Additional fit indices indicated the model did not fit the data. Exploratory analyses indicated men have increased psychological flexibility to women. There were no differences of study commitment and future study goals on burnout scores. These findings indicate South Australian universities should include self-care modules to support students to avoid burnout and improve wellbeing, while contributing to the literature the prevalence of burnout in this population.

49,Quantitative,,The Effects of Impulsivity and Polygenic Risk for BMI on the Development of Binge Eating Behaviour in Adolescents: Evidence from the CogBIAS Longitudinal Study,"Binge-eating disorder (BED), which is associated with obesity, has the highest lifetime prevalence of disordered eating behaviours. Previous literature on BED has focused primarily on clinical patients with obesity or adults. Due to escalating rates of obesity worldwide and the negative consequences of binge eating on physical and mental well-being it is becoming increasingly important to understand the psychological processes that underlie the tendency to binge eat. Previous research has identified that impulsive personality and genetic variation account for individual differences in disordered eating behaviour. The current study aims to investigate whether the polygenic risk score (PRS) for BMI moderates the relationship between different impulsivity traits and binge eating in a large sample of adolescents (N=312). Secondary data analysis was performed using data from wave 3 of the CogBias Longitudinal Study of Adolescents. Participants completed questionnaires that assessed binge eating and impulsive behaviour. Saliva samples were collected at the baseline assessment for genetic risk analyses. I hypothesis that higher levels of the multi-factorial concepts of impulsivity, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance and negative urgency, will be associated with increased levels of binge eating in adolescents, whereas sensation-seeking will not be associated. Additionally, PRS for BMI will moderate the relationships between each multi-factorial concept of impulsivity and binge eating. Broader implications and future directions regarding the outcomes of this study will be discussed. The present study will add to the growing body of literature by providing insight on how genetic variation interacts with the psychological processes associated with disordered eating.

50,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Supporting Families of Children with Craniosynostosis: Parent Use of Online Forums,"Background: Craniosynostosis causes the early fusion of cranial sutures, resulting in an abnormal head shape. Facing a medical diagnosis in a child is generally difficult for families to cope with. These families often rely on the internet to share their experiences, facilitate support and guidance, and promote awareness of craniosynostosis. Modern studies have focused on the perspective of the patient, and there is limited existing research examining the psychosocial impact of craniosynostosis on families. 
Objective: This study aims to analyse posts from online forums, intended for parents of children with craniosynostosis, to characterise the informational needs and experiences of patients. 
Methods: 4 public forums were identified and chosen for data collection. Threads were screened extracted from the forums based on relevance. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to systematically code significant features of the data and form overarching themes.
Results: 105 threads initiated from May 2019 to May 2024 were extracted from the forums. The reflexive thematic analysis yielded 4 overarching themes: seeking information to guide decisions, diagnosing craniosynostosis, treating craniosynostosis, and emotional support.  These themes provided insight into the diverse experiences and informational needs of families of children with craniosynostosis. 
Conclusions: Online forums allow families of children with craniosynostosis can share information and provide peer support.

51,Quantitative,,Re-Thinking Dual-Process Theories of Reasoning Development: Bias Detection and Inhibition in a Base-Rate Task,"Investigating the way we make judgements and assess probabilities given incomplete information or uncertain circumstances has been central to cognitive psychology research in past decades. Research has shown adult populations often rely on heuristic principles in decision-making involving probabilities and as such, thinking can be biased and lead to systematic errors in judgement. Among developmental populations, evidence of biased decision-making is less clear, indicating no fixed trend of improvement. Using a child-friendly base-rate task, pitting probability information against stereotypes, this study will examine the use of cues of 5-6 year olds and 11-12 year olds. A mixed factorial ANOVA will be performed to test main effects of base-rate, stereotype, stereotype familiarity, age, and all interactions. This study makes the following predictions: (1) There will be a larger familiarity effect for younger participants, than in older participants, and therefore for unfamiliar stereotypes, there will be no significant stereotype effect for younger participants; (2) There will be a larger base-rate effect for older participants, than for younger participants. A dominant theoretical framework to account for reasoning and decision-making is dual-process theories. Despite widespread support for dual-process theories, debate surrounds whether the dichotomy is warranted. In an exploratory investigation, data will be examined using state-trace analysis to determine if this provides evidence in support of dual-processes, or an alternative, single-process account.",Cognitive Psychology,Developmental Psychology,Experimental Psychology
52,Quantitative,,"The Effects of Veracity and Repetition of Political News Headlines on Political Polarisation, Institutional Trust and Perceived Truth","While misinformation has been identified as the largest global risk over the next two years (World Economic Forum, 2024), many journalists and academics have been attributing it to be the cause of increased levels of political polarisation and decreased institutional trust. However, recent reviews indicate that current research has only yielded mixed findings as to the clarity of these effects and that there is a lack of research progress to understanding these relationships. Consequently, the present study has been designed to understand the extent to which veracity and repetition of news headlines predict outcomes of polarisation, institutional trust and perceived truth of Australians. Additionally, the effect of belief in a just world (other) and political orientation as covariates to these relationships will be explored. It was predicted that repeated headline exposure will increase perceived truth, replicating the well-researched illusory truth effect. Additionally, it was predicted that individuals exposed to true headlines will report lower polarisation, higher institutional trust and higher perceived truth. To investigate these relationships, a within-between subjects randomised trial was conducted with 131 participants that were recruited from Australian online forums. Participants were exposed to either the true or false headline condition (between condition), some of which they were only exposed to once while other headlines they were repeatedly exposed to (within condition). These results will contribute to the existing literature in understanding the broader societal consequences of misinformation and how it may influence public opinion.",Political Psychology,Journalism Psychology,

By referring to the process of resilience which consists of a multifaceted interaction between different components. It has become widely accepted that core to this process are the components of agency and pathways thinking, that together facilitate the process toward positive adaption to adversity. The primary aim of this study is to examine the association of a major flood event against measures of trauma, depression and anxiety in a large population-based sample of (3521) primary school children, and whether this relationship is mitigated by resilience and mediated by external factors. This study will provide a comprehensive, empirically informed understanding of the relationship between various factors in predicting mental health and trauma outcomes for children facing a natural disaster.

Existing research emphasises that ACC is an inherently social problem which requires deep structural changes in the ways that society produces and consumes, which can only be facilitated by collective action. While the psychological mechanisms underlying collective action are well-researched, the question remains regarding how social psychology can assist in mobilising this alarmed segment of Australians. Research conducted by Whitson et al. (in press) analysed an Alarmed segment of the Australian community, finding that they are not a homogenous group. Rather sub-segments exist when comparing the motivations and barriers of participating in ACC collective action. The present study aims to build upon the prior research of Whitson et al.

55,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Hidden Narratives: Unveiling the Coming Out Experiences of Second-Generation LGBTQIA+ Asian Individuals. A Qualitative Thematic Analysis of Subreddit Posts,"Coming out is a crucial and complex aspect of an LGBTQIA+ individual's identity. For second-generation Asian individuals in Western, English-speaking countries, this process often involves reconciling their authentic selves with traditional cultural values and familial pressures. Despite growing interest in the experiences of gay Chinese individuals, the coming-out experiences of second-generation LGBTQIA+ Asians as a broader demographic remain underexplored. Reddit provides a platform for these individuals to share their experiences authentically, free from researcher influence. This study employs a thematic analysis within a critical realist framework to examine the coming-out experiences of second-generation LGBTQIA+ Asians on Reddit, highlighting perceived barriers and outcomes. Five themes emerged: The clash of traditional cultural identity with modern, Western, and LGBTQIA+ identities; Family pressure to uphold heteronormative family structures; Finding acceptance from their families but also within themselves; Process of coming out is complex and takes time; and Navigating relationship with parents after coming out. These results are interpreted through Social Identity Theory and Co-cultural Theory to address the intricate social and cultural factors affecting these intersectional identities. this study would therefore contribute to a deeper understanding of how second-generation LGBTQIA+ Asian individuals navigate the complex intersections of their cultural generational and sexual identities. The focus on this specific demographic could potentially highlight new challenges and resilience strategies that have yet not been considered, thus offering insights into the more nuanced experiences of these individuals.

56,Quantitative,,Collective Influence of Internal and External Protective Factors on Adolescent Mental health,"Rates of anxiety and depression are rising among adolescents globally, prompting interest in the resilience-related factors that can protect individuals against such challenges. While these factors –both internal (e.g. sense of agency, coping strategies) and external (e.g. family and school environments) – have been widely researched individually, few studies have examined their collective influence on adolescent mental health. Using data from a large omnibus survey administered to a nationally representative sample of Australian adolescents aged between 12-18 (N = 79,134), this study first employed exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to identify key resilience-related factors within this population. These factors were then subjected to structural equation modelling to explore the direct and indirect pathways through which they influence symptoms of anxiety and depression (i.e., Internalising Symptoms). Among external factors, results revealed Family Support to have the largest negative effect on Internalising Symptoms, both directly and indirectly, with Adaptive Behaviours, Sense of Agency and Pathways, and Avoidant Coping all acting as partial mediators. School Connectedness primarily exerted its protective influence indirectly via Adaptive Behaviours and Sense of Agency and Pathways, though it also demonstrated a minor, positive indirect effect through Avoidant Coping. The negative effect of Friendships on Internalising Symptoms was entirely mediated by Adaptive Behaviours, Sense of Agency and Pathways, and Avoidant Coping. Among internal factors, Avoidant Coping had the largest direct effect on Internalising Symptoms, which was substantial and positive, while Adaptive Behaviours and Sense of Agency and Pathways both exerted significant negative effects. These findings highlight critical pathways that may inform the development of resilience-building interventions aimed at preventing mental health issues in youth.",Developmental Psychology,Public Health,Psychometrics
57,Quantitative,,Evaluation of a Brief Crisis Intervention (Gold Card SA) for Young People (16 and 17 years of age) with Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms,"Individuals living with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) commonly struggle to regulate their emotions and often experience self-harm and suicidal behaviours. Suicide is currently the leading cause of death for young Australians aged 15-24. Individuals living with BPD also experience higher rates of premature mortality. The provision of effective psychological interventions that meet the diverse needs of young people with emerging symptoms of BPD is a moral imperative, when aiming to reduce current rates of youth suicide.

This observational study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief crisis intervention (Gold Card SA) in reducing the severity of BPD symptoms for young people (16 and 17 years of age). Gold Card SA is four sessions, developed by Project Air, and offered as part of a broader stepped care approach within the South Australian tertiary mental health sector to treating BPD. 109 participants were referred after presenting to a hospital emergency department in a mental health crisis and experiencing one or more symptoms of BPD. Participants were initially screened using McLean’s Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality (MSI-BPD). They then completed the Borderline symptom list-23 (BSL -23), Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ) and The Work and Social Adjustment Scale for Youth (WSAS-Y). After completing the intervention, participants completed these measures again, to look at symptom improvement and assess intervention effectiveness.

Initial results are promising, with mean improvement found across all outcome measures post intervention. Further exploration of how suitable brief interventions like Gold Card SA are in addressing the mental health needs of young people is recommended.

58,Quantitative,,Navigating Loneliness: Exploring Social Media's Dual Influence During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK,"The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially altered social interactions, prompting increased reliance on social media as a means of connection. Previous literature has highlighted both the positive and negative impacts of social media use (SMU) on mental health, particularly in relation to loneliness. This study investigates the dual influence of SMU on loneliness during the pandemic, guided by the Transactional Stress and Coping Model (TSCM). Specifically, we examine how different motives for SMU moderate this relationship across adolescents and parents.

We hypothesize that adolescents who use social media for socializing will experience lower levels of loneliness, while those using it for avoidance will experience higher levels. In contrast, we predict that parents who use social media for socializing will experience higher levels of loneliness, whereas those using it for avoidance will experience lower levels. We also assess the impact of neutral motives on loneliness. Using a cross-sectional design, this study analyses data collected as part of The Oxford Achieving Resilience During COVID-19 (ARC) study, which includes responses from 1,196 adolescents aged 13-18 and 462 parents collected between March 2020 and August 2021. Hierarchical linear regression analyses will examine the relationship between SMU and loneliness, and how different motives moderate this relationship.

Our findings are expected to provide a nuanced understanding of how social media can serve both as a coping mechanism and a potential stressor.

59,Quantitative,,Exploring the Influence of Trauma on Boundary Judgments: How Previous Trauma Alters Memory for Negative Scenes,"After viewing negative scenes, people often remember central details more than peripheral details and recall feeling closer to the scene. This phenomenon is termed Boundary Restriction and occurs as a result of people misremembering closer proximity to a scene than they actually were. Boundary restriction is inconsistent in literature; however, the opposing phenomenon of boundary extension is well-established and robust. Boundary extension occurs when people misremember further proximity to a scene. This study aimed to investigate how past traumatic experience affects people’s memory of negative scenes. Participants completed measures of trauma exposure and trauma symptomology and then viewed 10 disgust and 10 neutral scenes. After a 5-minute distraction task, participants were shown the same scenes and asked if they had been altered, i.e., if they were closer, further, or identical. Participants selected the extent to which they believed the scenes had been changed. Unexpectedly, participants with trauma made more boundary extension errors - that is, they misremembered being farther from the scenes - and fewer boundary restriction errors. This was the first known study to explore the effect of previous trauma on boundary judgements for disgust stimuli. These findings suggest that previous trauma exposure may affect peoples’ memory of subsequent negative scenes.  ",Cognitive Psychology,Perception,Individual Differences
60,Quantitative,,Examining the role of intellectual humility and cognitive bias in explaining the relationships between non-evidence-based beliefs,"Non-evidence-based beliefs are defined as beliefs that are unsupported or disproven by evidence and science. Non-evidence-based beliefs are associated with several negative outcomes such as risky health decisions, political violence, and extremism. Within this study, we examined the interrelationships between three domains of non-evidence-based beliefs (conspiracy, paranormal, and pseudoscientific beliefs) and whether these relationships are (partially) explained by intellectual humility and susceptibility to cognitive biases. Participants completed a battery of cognitive bias measures, along with survey measures of non-evidence-based beliefs and intellectual humility. We predicted that intellectual humility would be negatively related to all non-evidence-based beliefs and that cognitive biases would be positively related to all non-evidence-based beliefs. We also predicted that intellectual humility would be associated with non-evidence-based beliefs both directly and indirectly via cognitive biases. Our final prediction was that intellectual humility and cognitive bias would explain a significant portion of the relationships between the three non-evidence-based beliefs. These predictions will be tested using correlation and partial correlation, linear multiple regression, and a structural equation model. The results of this study will provide insight into whether intellectual humility and cognitive biases partially underpin the relationships between various non-evidence-based beliefs. This also has the potential to inform future interventions, as it would suggest that promoting intellectual humility and/or reducing cognitive bias may be an effective approach for reducing susceptibility to a broad range of non-evidence-based beliefs.",Cognitive Psychology,Personality Psychology,Social Psychology
61,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Exploring the experiences of occupational hazards and risks on the spouses of doctors,"Occupational hazards are situations in a workplace that have the potential to harm the health and safety of people or the environment, and present with a risk of occurrence. An occupation that has been identified to hold a high susceptibility to such risks and hazards is doctors, who have been identified as the most vulnerable group among health professionals. In the presence of such experiences, doctors have been confirmed to seek out the support of their spouses. However, to best understand the role of a supportive spouse in assisting doctors to navigate occupational risks and hazards, it is imperative to consider not only the support they provide but also their experience in offering this support, to assist in the retention of doctors. The present study therefore sought to answer the question “What are the experiences of families of doctors who face occupational risks and hazards”. An online subreddit community, found on the website Reddit, was used to collect posts made by individuals as spouses of doctors. A thematic analysis was performed on posts dating from the 1st to the 31st of March 2024. The thematic analysis revealed novel findings concerning the emotional and physical burdens associated with their doctor’s occupational hazards and risks, along with how spouses have experienced challenges and their associated coping strategies. The preliminary results have confirmed that the abundance of occupational hazards and risks doctors face extend, and greatly affect their spouses, along with the diverse role that spouses play in supporting their doctors.

Gacha games are game similar with loot boxes, by giving the option of utilising money to purchase in-game currency to gamble or to gain a better experience when playing. 

Loot box’s monetised features and gambling aspects has been explored in prior studies, but little research has examined in the monetised features of gacha games and what aspects of individuals differences are associated with larger purchases of monetised features and gambling. By exploring this topic, allowing a better understanding and awareness on the cause of expenditure in potential gambling susceptible individuals. 

A sample of 443 participants aged between 18-45 recruited through the online subreddit r/gachagaming, completed an online questionnaire. Measures include subscales of Delayed Gratification Inventory, the Online Fear-of-Missing-Out Scale, Problem Gambling Severity Index, and Player Avatar Identification Scale. Participant’s engagement with gacha games and purchase expenditures was also measured. 

Hypotheses of the study consisting of: 1) Participants with higher levels of FOMO are more susceptible to purchase monetised features to elevate their chances of obtaining better characters, 2) Participants who have lower delay-of-gratification are more likely to purchase monetised features to obtain highly sought after characters, 3) Participants with problem gambling will be more likely to look for monetary shortcuts to increase their chances of obtaining highly sought after characters, and 4) Participants who feel more connected to a character (avatar identification) are more likely to purchase monetised features to obtain the desired characters.

63,Meta-Synthesis,Meta-Aggregation,Life in the in-between: The identity experiences of being born between ethnic and Western cultures – a qualitative meta-synthesis,"Global trends and events in the 21st century have contributed to an increase in human migration, particularly into developed Western nations. The children of these migrants are thus born between their ancestral ethnic culture and Western home culture. Traditional identity theories, which have gained traction within academia and subsequently into mainstream discourse, do not completely account for the unique experiences of being born between cultures. Existing research often focuses on one specific ethnicity; thus, there lacks a unified body of evidence to support existing, but lesser known, ‘in-between’ identity theories. To provide such support, this study synthesised existing qualitative research using the meta-aggregation approach. It focused on adult-aged, Western-nation born, first-generation children of non-Western migrants. Twenty-five publications were included, representing 351 participants with 34 quantifiable non-Western ancestries, across four Western home nations. Three synthesised findings were developed from the data: (i) structural forces, (ii) everyday experiences, (iii) making sense of oneself. Respectively, they align with macrosystem, microsystem, and individual factors. Two findings – ‘in-between is expected’, and ‘the lifespan perspective’ – remained un-synthesised as they encapsulated a broad overview of identity as suggested by ‘in-between’ theories. The current deficit perception of in-between identities, alongside existing rigid group-belonging schemas, contributed to everyday experiences that challenged a coherent sense of personal identity. A novel response was to engage in creative acts of activism and redefinitions. However, individual-level acts are often unsustainable without support from the underlying macrosystem structures. Therefore, recommendations should first focus on normalising contemporary ways of experiencing ethnic-national identities.",Social Psychology,,
64,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Motherhood and Borderline Personality Disorder: Exploring Understandings of the Mother-Infant Relationship Following Participation in Mother-Infant Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (MI-DBT+),"Motherhood is inherently demanding, and for women with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), these demands are further amplified by their experiences with severe emotional dysregulation. The exacerbation of BPD symptoms from parental-related stressors can have adverse impacts on the mother-infant dyad, including strained interactions, weaker relational bonds and insecure attachments. Given the critical role of the mother-infant relationship in a child’s emotional, social, and cognitive development, it is essential to provide early support for these dyads, to foster secure attachment and healthy developmental outcomes. This study investigates the impacts of MI-DBT+, an innovative therapeutic intervention which integrates Mother-Infant Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (MI-DBT) as a known effective intervention for people with BPD, with Attachment and Biobehavioural Catch-Up (ABC) therapy. Grounded in Attachment Theory, which emphasizes the importance of secure early bonds for emotional development, this research explores how mothers with BPD perceive and reflect on their relationships with their infants, following completion of the MI-DBT+ program. Using reflexive thematic analysis, the study analyses mothers’ reflections of their experiences and the program’s role in enhancing the mother-infant relationship. Participants (N=8) were recruited through purposive sampling led by the Helen Mayo House Research Team and had completed MI-DBT and an additional ten sessions of ABC therapy, respectively. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in participant’s homes by research officers from WCHN. Preliminary findings indicate that MI-DBT+ supports improvements in the mother-infant bond through the promotion of healthy relationship dynamics, increased dyadic interactions and equipping mothers with tools to support emotional regulation for themselves and their child.

As the threat of climate change intensifies and urban populations expand, encouraging participation in greening initiatives—such as community gardens, revegetation projects and habitat restoration efforts—is becoming increasingly crucial for enhancing community health and well-being. Despite this, the motivations driving involvement in greening initiatives, particularly the potential for health benefits to drive participation, remains underexplored. The current study seeks to explore the underlying motivations of greening initiative volunteers and organisers within an Adelaide council area through a qualitative mixed methods sequential design. The Theory of Planned Behaviour's three key components—attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control—were considered in the construction of semi-structured interview questions to best understand the cognitive antecedents to greening initiative involvement. Participants (N=13) recruited through purposive sampling engaged in a focus group led by the student researcher, in which the benefits, consequences, barriers and facilitators of greening involvement were discussed. Following this discussion, three semi-structured interviews were conducted to further explore these topics in greater depth. The focus group and interviews were transcribed for the purpose of Reflexive Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2022).

67,Quantitative,,Examining the Effectiveness of Argumentation Strategies for Neutral and Conspiratorial Claims,"Misinformation and conspiracy theories can have negative societal consequences such as poor health outcomes, political polarization, and radical behaviour.  Although there are several existing interventions to counter conspiratorial thinking, there is limited experimental research on the efficacy of different argumentation styles for producing belief change in conspiratorial and neutral claims. There is existing evidence that individuals vary in susceptibility to different argumentation strategies, and this may be particularly relevant for conspiracy theories which often rely on distrust, cognitive biases, logical fallacies and weak evidence. Therefore, within this experiment we examined the efficacy of three simplified methods of argumentation; ethos (credibility), logos (logical reasoning), and datum (statistical evidence). We also examined whether argumentation efficacy differs across individuals based on their level of conspiratorial thinking and attitudes towards evidence. Participants viewed a series of conspiratorial and neutral claims and provided an initial belief rating for each claim. They then viewed an argument for or against that claim, which relied on one of the above three argumentation strategies (ethos, logos, datum), before providing a second belief rating. The results of this study will provide insight into the most efficacious argumentation strategies for neutral and conspiratorial claims, as well as whether these differ across individuals based on their general conspiratorial thinking and openness to evidence. These results will help inform future interventions to counter conspiratorial beliefs, and will better equip researchers and the broader populace to engage in effective argumentation to address deeply ingrained and potentially harmful beliefs.

","Automation has become widespread in many critical domains in society where automated decision aids are deployed to improve decision making. When benchmarked to the predictions of models of collaborative decision making, however, past research has indicated that humans interact with automation suboptimally. Notably, these exercises have focused on cases where the aid is unbiased (i.e., equally prone towards misses and false alarms). Research has demonstrated that false alarms from an aid have a deleterious effect on performance, relative to misses. The present study extends previous benchmarking efforts using aids prone towards false alarms and misses. Participants (N=80) performed a simulated baggage x-ray screening task requiring them to identify the presence of a knife in each image. They completed the task unassisted and with assistance from an 80%-reliable aid prone to either false alarms or misses. Automation-aided performance was benchmarked against three models of collaborative decision-making, each of which made a different assumption as to how agents integrate information to reach a joint decision. Consistent with past research, false-alarm prone automation caused a decline in performance relative to equally reliable miss-prone automation. For those assisted by a false alarm-prone aid, performance most closely matched a model that assumes participants defer to the aid at a rate equal to that of the aid’s reliability, while for those assisted by a miss-prone aid, performance most closely matched a model that assumes participants defer to the most reliable agent.

However, recent changes such as the 24-hour media cycle have transformed the way we consume information, with news now being constantly updated, and headlines competing for our attention. Alongside these changes, trust in news and news outlets has decreased, and there is growing concern about belief in conspiracy theories. Therefore, within this experiment we examined the impact of article format (long form, short news update) and story consistency (consistent, changing) on trust and conspiratorial thinking. Research was conducted using an online survey in which participants each viewed four separate news articles (one per condition). After each article they indicated their level of trust in the article, author, and news source, and answered a series of questions measuring their conspiratorial thinking about the article. Participants also completed scales of general conspiratorial thinking and intellectual humility. We predicted that articles presented as news updates (rather than long format) and with a changing (rather than consistent) story would lead to reduced trust and greater conspiratorial thinking about the article topic. The findings of this study will provide greater insight into the effects of news format and story consistency on trust and conspiratorial thinking, as well as whether these impacts differ based on general conspiratorial thinking and level of intellectual humility. These findings may also provide guidance on how news communication can be improved to increase trust and reduce conspiratorial thinking.

72,Quantitative,,Developing dual processes: exploring the role of base rates and stereotype familiarity in children’s reasoning development,"Several decades of literature has shown that adults have a tendency neglect base-rates in favour of more intuitively appealing heuristic information (i.e. stereotypes) when making judgements, referred to as base-rate bias. Dual process theories have been used to explain this phenomenon, which hold that reasoning is driven by two distinct processes; Type 1, which is intuitive, fast, and context-dependent, and Type 2, which is slow, analytical, and requires working memory. However, efforts to extend dual process accounts to work with children have not always shown expected developmental trends, with younger children often showing more logical reasoning than older children, or even adults. This may be explained by the need for stereotype knowledge to develop. Further, the use of dissociations to rule out a single process account may be inaccurate, due to linearity assumptions. The present study aimed to explore base-rate bias in children, examining whether developmental reversals can be replicated, and the role of stereotype familiarity in reasoning development. We also aimed to use State-Trace Analysis to discern whether a single process account can be rejected in favour of dual processes. Participants (target sample = 100) aged 5-6 and 8-9, completed a child-friendly base-rate task iPad game, adapted from De Neys and Vanderputte (2011). Problems varied in base-rate and stereotype information, as well as stereotype familiarity for the younger group. The results are discussed relative to their implications for understanding reasoning development in children, and the potential to inform intervention programs to reduce bias in reasoning from a young age.

73,Quantitative,,Examining the effect of ironic prosody on sentence processing using electroencephalography,"Irony is a type of speech that relies heavily on prosody and can completely change the meaning of a statement. The time-course of how people process ironic sentences has been examined using electroencephalography (EEG), where the congruency of a sentence is manipulated by presenting a word that can change the meaning of the sentence depending on the prosody used (e.g., ""A feather dropped on my foot and it hurt"", is congruent with an ironic but not literal meaning). Typically, these studies have used a critical word that is emotionally laden and 'feeling' centred. This may explain why such studies have found late interpretive but not earlier semantic differences caused by prosody, as such words typically elicit weak semantic effects in other types of sentence processing tasks. Using 26 participants, we examined this by comparing semantic violations in prosodically neutral sentences (e.g., ""The cow ate stones/grass"") with similar violations using an ironic tone using critical words that were not emotionally laden. The results showed that in the N400 window, where semantic effects are typically elicited, there was an effect of congruency only with the prosodically neutral sentences. The opposite pattern was found with Late Positive Components, which are generally thought to be caused by interpretive differences. In this case, an effect of congruency was found with ironic by not prosodically neutral sentences. These results suggest that it is not the type of word that causes a lack of semantic differences between incongruency caused by semantics and incongruencies cause by irony, but rather ironic prosody is likely to cause a qualitatively different type of processing that occurs at the sentence level, which then affects the way the semantics of words are processed.",Cognitive Psychology,Individual Differences,
74,Quantitative,,Perceived Financial Stress and Mental Health Help Seeking Behaviour: A Longitudinal Study with Psychologically Distressed Emerging Adults,"Emerging adulthood or late adolescents is a critical developmental period for supporting growth into a healthy adult. Psychological distress is on the rise among emerging adults and associated with the onset of mental health disorders. Access to appropriate services is essential in protecting against mental health disorders, however access can be limited due to perceived barriers to care such as cost, stigma, and mental health literacy. Research indicates that individuals experiencing financial stress are less likely to engage in formal mental health help seeking behaviour as they may not have the funds to do so. With incidences of perceived financial stress also on the rise among emerging adults, the Health Belief Model is used to guide our understanding in the relationship between cost as a barrier to care and formal mental health help seeking behaviour, as well as the role that other perceived barriers to care play in this relationship, as they may account for variations in help seeking behaviour despite financial constraints. This study aimed to investigate whether perceived financial stress was negatively associated with formal mental health help seeking behaviour among psychologically distressed emerging adults, and whether perceived barriers to care mediate this relationship. Data was obtained from psychological distressed participants aged 18-22 who completed Wave 9 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 1,532).

75,Quantitative,,The Impact of Facial Hair on Facial Recognition: A Comparative Study of Adults and Children in a Card Sorting Paradigm,"Facial recognition is a process essential for identifying and recognising others. Previous research has primarily focused on face-matching accuracy, but the impact of facial hair on recognition during a card-sorting task still needs to be explored. Studies show that adults struggle with facial recognition when faces include accessories or facial expressions, often creating more piles. Similarly, Children face challenges due to their limited exposure to diverse faces, with previous research identifying recognition to develop similarly to adults between 6-12 years of age. 

This study investigates how bearded faces affect recognition in adults and children using a cord-sorting paradigm. We hypothesise that adults will create more identity piles in the bearded condition compared to clean-shaven faces. Due to limited facial recognition experience, we also predict that children will make more piles than adults in the bearded condition. Additionally, we expect the mixed condition (clean-shaven and bearded faces) will be most challenging for both groups, creating more or similar piles to bearded condition. 

We experimented with 116 participants (66 children aged 3-15 and 51 adults aged 18+). Participants sorted cards of faces into identity piles across three conditions, clean-shaven, beaded and mixed. The stimuli consisted of Dutch celebrities. Photos of the piles were recorded to analyse the amount of piles made. Repeated measures ANOVA and Linear mixed model were used to analyse comparisons between adults and children as participants completed sets of 10 or 20 cards.

Results showed adults made more piles for bearded faces than clean-shaven faces, with the highest number of piles for the mixed condition. Children exhibited a similar pattern, creating the most piles for mixed condition, however, their results were not significant, illustrating that children potentially don’t pick up on the beard to be a main difference in recognising different faces. This result is surprising as previous research illustrates that children do pay attention to beardedness and can infer dominance traits in adults with beards. This infers that facial recognition can change through development with a focus on beards and how this may be a learned factor influencing how children see faces with minimal focus on features. This leads the way for future research into this non-significant effect and how our recognition changes through development.

76,Quantitative,,Interparental Conflict in Early Childhood: A Predictor for Adolescent Mental Health in Australia,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association between interparental conflict during the first five years of life and adolescent mental health, using a longitudinal, nationally representative sample. Further, it aimed to explore the effect of repeated exposure to interparental conflict. Current research suggests that interparental conflict during childhood has a negative impact on children’s later mental health and that repeated and single timepoint early-life exposure to interparental conflict is associated with mental health and behaviour problems at age 10-11 years. To date, research is limited in understanding whether this detrimental effect persists into adolescence. It was hypothesised that children exposed to interparental conflict between age 0-5 years will score higher on the SDQ at age 14-15 years than children who were not exposed to interparental conflict, Further, it was hypothesised that children exposed to interparental conflict at 2 or more times between age 0-5 years will be more likely to score within the borderline/abnormal range on the SDQ at age 14-15 years than children exposed at a single timepoint or whose parents did not report experiencing interparental conflict between ages 0-5 years. The study uses existing longitudinal data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children Release 9.1 C2 B Cohort, in particular, data from the Argumentative Relationship Scale collected in Waves 1, 2, and 3 and data from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire collected in Wave 8. At the commencement of Wave 1, participants were 2021 children (1043 male, 978 female), aged 0-1 years.",Developmental Psychology,,
77,Quantitative,,Anthropomorphism & AI: Investigating How Personality And Our Need For Survival Mediates Our Relationship With AI,"The global expansion in the availability, accessibility, and implementation of Large Language models (sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence models), coupled with an increase in funding and the proliferation of LLM’s on the internet has been a boon to a once struggling AI industry (Kshetri, 2024; Hendler, 2008). This study investigates the role of effectance motivation in anthropomorphizing large language models (LLMs), with a focus on understanding how manipulating perceptions of an LLM’s “capability” influences human-AI interactions. Grounded in the three-factor theory of anthropomorphism, which suggests that the need for understanding and control drives people to attribute human-like qualities to non-human entities, while additionally exploring the role of individual differences in anthropomorphism of LLM’s (Guthrie, 1993; Waytz et al., 2010; Epley, Waytz & Cacciopo, 2007). 
Participants (N = X) were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: an experimental group where Ash was framed as highly capable and human-like, and a control group where Ash's capabilities were downplayed to minimize effectance motivation. The employed a quantitative with between subjects and within subjects in a single factor experimental design. Quantitative data were collected using the Individual Differences in Anthropomorphism Questionnaire (IDAQ), Perceived Efficacy Scale, and the NEO-FFI-III personality inventory, while chat histories was obtained from participants' conversations with Ash (utilised in content analysis). Data analysis involved linear mixed models for quantitative data and content analysis of chat histories to assess anthropomorphic language. The findings are expected to contribute to the understanding of human-AI interaction, guide future research into whether LLM’s are fit for purpose and be a key step towards addressing the ethics of implementing LLM's and other 'artificial intelligence' models across a variety of areas of life.

78,Quantitative,,Victim Blaming on Social Media: A Study of Social Conformity and Credibility,"The influence of social media on criminal trials, particularly those involving sexual assault, warrants critical examination. While social conformity and rape stereotypes have been individually examined in relation to victim blame, the intersection between these factors has not been extensively studied. Despite legal reforms, rape myths continue to persist, impacting juror objectivity and judicial outcomes. This study investigated the interaction between credibility and online conforming behaviour by examining the association between social conformity, blame assignment, and rape myth acceptance. Credibility was operationalised as either expertise, education or experience with sexual assault. The study utilised a 2 (Relationship Scenario: Housemate, Marriage) × 3 (Commenter Credentials: Expert, Educated, Experienced) mixed experimental vignette design. A total of 136 participants viewed vignettes formatted as Facebook posts, with accompanying comments, detailing sexual assault cases. Participants rated victim and perpetrator blame, perceived promiscuity and blameworthiness, credibility, social conformity, and rape myth acceptance. Findings indicate a relationship between blame attribution and rape myth acceptance, consistent with previous research. Contrary to predictions, there was no significant relationship between social conformity and rape myth acceptance, and perpetrators were perceived as more promiscuous than victims. Commenters who were ‘Experts’ were significantly more influential than ‘Educated’ commenters or commenters with lived ‘Experience.’ These findings underscore the role of user-generated content in shaping public perceptions and highlight the need for strategies to mitigate biases in juror decision-making.",Perception,Social Psychology,Forensic Psychology
79,Quantitative,,Can Experienced Stigma Mediate the Relationship Between Psychosocial Safety Climate and Depression?,"Employees with mental health problems often encounter stigma in the workplace, including discriminatory attitudes and behaviours, which impact their mental health negatively and delay the recovery. Despite legal obligations to protect mental health, current workplace interventions often focus more on individual factors rather than organisational conditions. This study aims to investigate the direct relationship between Psychosocial Safety Climate (PSC) and the severity of depressive symptoms, as well as the indirect effect of experienced stigma (ES) on this relationship. It hypothesizes that a high PSC correlates with lower levels of ES and depressive symptoms, while a low PSC exacerbates both ES and depressive symptoms. Additionally, the study proposed that ES partially mediates the relationship between PSC and depression, providing a nuanced perspective on how workplace environments influence mental health. 
237 participants from the Australian Workplace Barometer (AWB) project, who met the selection criteria and provided relevant data across two waves (2021 and 2022), were included in this longitudinal study. Attrition, descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted using the SPSS, while the mediation analysis was performed using maximum likelihood parameter estimates in the Mplus. 
The findings could guide interventions to improve workplace inclusion, address stigma, and enhance mental health outcomes, emphasising the critical role of organisational factors in supporting employee well-being. ",Organisational Psychology,,
80,Quantitative,,Boundary Restriction and Trait Anxiety: Investigating the Effect of Individual Differences on Memory for Proximity,"When presented with an image of a real-world scene, people tend to recall the image with extrapolated boundaries–a phenomenon known as Boundary Extension. However, when these images become more negative, the effect can reverse, resulting in people recalling being further from an image than they actually were. Understanding visual memory errors is important, particularly for negative scenes, for example in eyewitness testimony and in high-stress occupations. Although Boundary Extension is robust, evidence for the reverse effect–Boundary Restriction–is less consistent. Previous studies have demonstrated that increased arousal, driven by individual differences, such as trait anxiety, and negative image valence can lead to Boundary Restriction. However, the specific effect of disgust-eliciting images on Boundary Restriction remains unexplored. This study examines the impact of trait anxiety and disgust sensitivity on Boundary Restriction. Participants completed a trait anxiety scale and a disgust sensitivity and propensity scale, before viewing 10 neutral and 10 disgust images, followed by a 10-minute break. They were then shown these same images again, and asked to indicate whether the image had changed, whether it was closer or farther than the original. Consistent with the robustness of Boundary Extension, participants made more Boundary Extension than Boundary Restriction errors overall. Surprisingly, participants made more Boundary Extension errors for disgust images than for neutral images. As predicted, high trait anxiety resulted in increased Boundary Restriction errors, but only for disgust images. Our findings suggest that while Boundary Extension is robust, trait anxiety can influence peoples’ memory for proximity.",Cognitive Psychology,Perception,Individual Differences
81,Quantitative,,The Role of Self-Labelling and Causal Attributions in Stigma and Help-Seeking Behaviours Among Problem Gamblers,"Stigma has been identified throughout the literature as a barrier to help-seeking for problem gambling individuals. It has been argued that stigma surrounding the disorder has been compounded by individualized, pathological approaches to problem gambling, the use of labels such as 'problem gambler' and assumptions of personal responsibility pertaining to the origin of the disorder. As a result, calls for the use of 'person-first' language such as ""person harmed by gambling"" have become increasingly prevalent within the public health paradigm. This movement is potentially problematic, given research suggests favourable treatment successes are influenced by personal recognition of problems, acceptance of addiction or pathology, and understanding of the required behavioural changes. The present study aims to explore a noticeable gap in the current literature, employing a cross-sectional design, a sample of 300 gambling individuals completed an online self-report survey to examine a problem gambler's self-perceived attributions for the origin of their condition, the labels they use to describe their addiction, the implications on perceptions of societal stigma and help-seeking behaviours. It was hypothesized that favourable help-seeking outcomes were more likely to be observed amongst individuals who had exhibited problem recognition and those who held internal attributions for their problem's origin. Further, we hypothesized that individuals with internal causal attributions would perceive greater levels of social stigma. Future research exploring the role of causal attributions and labelling is crucial to shaping the direction of public health paradigms surrounding the abrogation of pathological terminology.

82,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,"Exploring the Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes of Inpatient Mental Health Psychologists in Australia","Psychologists within a mental health inpatient setting are expected to demonstrate a number of skills; including but not limited to clinical assessments of patients, facilitating interventions and treatments, providing consultations to patients and other healthcare professionals, administration, and teaching and training of students and other health care providers. Considering the high demand of this role, the research on psychologists in mental health inpatient settings is extremely limited. Traditionally, qualitative research in the area of inpatient settings has also primarily focussed on service users, providing an important perspective, but there is little research on the experiences of psychologists. Furthermore the competencies required to deliver such services in the inpatient mental health context has not been studied in an Australian context. What makes inpatient psychology different is the requirement to work with a medical model as well as multidisciplinary teams that are mostly made of medical staff. A previous study by Small et al. (2018) sought to examine the perspective of psychologists and service users in inpatient wards and reported a number of challenges psychologists experience in this setting.  Previous research highlights the unique aspects of psychological care in inpatient settings and this qualitative study aimed to identify such competencies in terms of the Knowledge, skills and Attitudes considered by participants as important to working as a psychologist in an inpatient setting. 30 psychologists living and working in Australia who currently or previously worked in an inpatient setting completed an online survey. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. The results comprised of 6 competencies that also encompassed a number of corresponding and overlapping KSA’s. This study provides an important contribution to the knowledge and development of competencies of psychologists in inpatient settings. The findings could be used to enhance consumer care by informing future practice through providing valuable guidance and expectations of this role.",Clinical Psychology,Organisational Psychology,Health Psychology
84,Quantitative,,Exploring the Effect of Scientific Jargon: A Study on Forensic Expert Evidence,"Specialised terminology, or jargon, is often used to convey knowledge between experts and lay audiences. While some literature suggests that jargon diminishes credibility and comprehension, others indicate the opposite. Despite recommendations to avoid jargon in forensic expert reports, there is little empirical evidence to support this advice. In legal contexts, where judges and juries must interpret complex information, jargon may lead to flawed decisions, potentially resulting in wrongful convictions or unjust acquittals. This study aims to clarify mixed findings by empirically testing the effects of jargon on the perceived credibility of forensic experts and the comprehension of their evidence. We predict that jargon will negatively impact the perceived credibility of experts and expert evidence, in addition to comprehension. An online experiment was conducted with 126 participants from Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Canada. The study used a between-subjects design, randomly assigning participants to either a high-jargon or low-jargon condition. Participants evaluated eight mock forensic expert statements, rating their perceived credibility, comprehension, and the likelihood of the accused’s guilt after each statement. The results will highlight the importance of clear communication in legal contexts and may guide future research to determine appropriate levels of jargon in expert testimonies. This study contributes to the empirical evidence needed to improve the accuracy of laypersons' judgments and reduce the risk of wrongful convictions.

85,Quantitative,,How Living Location and Social Factors Influence Nature Connection in Australian Children and Adolescents,"Nature is an important aspect of everyday life, but as the world is becoming more urbanised, our ability to connect and interact with nature is becoming more difficult. Social factors can influence how we spend time in nature, so by understanding how urbanisation and social factors combine to influence nature connection (NC) is becoming increasingly more important. The aim of this study was to investigate how living location, and social factors influence NC in children and adolescents living across Australia. A total of 104,201 children across primary and secondary school age (age range = 9-17 years; M = 12.7, SD = 2.05) completed a survey for this study. To understand how social factors influence NC, factor analysis identified factors of family support, friendships, teacher support, and bullying. To test differences in outcomes between the living locations of metropolitan, regional, rural, and remote areas (based off of the Modified Monash Model) a MANOVA was conducted and indicated significant differences between the groups. A multigroup structural equation model was then used to determine the difference in the relationships between factors according to living locations. Preliminary analysis indicating a good model fit CFI (0.981), TFI (0.977), and subsequent analyses will further elucidate how urbanisation and social factors influence NC in children. Such findings will help shape approaches toward a sustainable and inviting environment for future generations.

86,Quantitative,,Understanding the influence of smartwatch distractions and traffic conditions on driver performance and mental workload,"This study aims to investigate the effects of smartwatch distractions and varying traffic conditions on driving performance and mental workload. Specifically, it examines whether text message distractions delivered via smartwatches impair driving performance more severely under high-traffic conditions compared to low-traffic conditions. The research employs a 2x2 repeated measures design involving 60 licensed drivers, who will be exposed to four experimental conditions: high traffic with distraction, low traffic with distraction, high traffic without distraction, and low traffic without distraction. Participants will engage in a driving simulation, during which their driving accuracy (e.g., lane deviation, speed control, reaction time) and cognitive load (assessed through self-reports and physiological measures) will be measured.

The study draws on cognitive load theory and selective attention theory to hypothesize that smartwatch distractions will worsen driving performance and increase cognitive load, particularly in high-traffic environments. Statistical analyses, including two-way repeated measures ANOVA, will be conducted to evaluate the main and interaction effects of the independent variables (traffic density and smartwatch distraction) on the dependent variables (driving performance and cognitive load). 

The findings are expected to contribute to our understanding of human-technology interaction in driving contexts and may inform the design of safer driving environments by identifying key factors that exacerbate driver distraction. This research holds significance for public safety, particularly in relation to the increasing integration of wearable technology into daily life.

87,Quantitative,,"Exploring the relationships between Psychological Flexibility and Centrality to Life of Sporting Goals, Sports Confidence and Perceived Performance: A study of competitive athletes","There is an inherent expectation on athletes to persevere through stressful circumstances to demonstrate successful performance. How athletes relate to competitive situations and ultimately, appraise and cope with the demands of competition is thought to influence sporting success. Psychological flexibility (PF) which encompasses the ability to pursue meaningful goals despite the presence of distress, has been linked to successful sports performance. While psychologically flexible actions are willingly enacted to reach a goal, this conceptualisation has been somewhat ignored. A link between PF and the centrality of a sporting goal to an athlete’s life is proposed in this study given that goal centrality has been associated with engagement in goal directed behaviours and adaptive coping strategies. Further, sports confidence has been positively associated with perceived coping abilities, flexible internal experiences, goal commitment and performance. However, no studies have investigated the relationship between PF and centrality to life of sporting goals, sports confidence and perceived performance together. This study sought to better understand PF in the athletic pursuit and how it may relate to the centrality of sporting goals, as well as an athlete’s sports confidence and perceived performance. It was hypothesised that athletes with greater PF would possess sporting goals that were more central to their life, whilst also demonstrating greater sports confidence and perceived performance. This study included 101 recreational, semi-professional and professional level athletes, over the age of 18 years. Participants completed an online survey examining measures of PF, centrality to life, sports confidence and perceived performance. ",Sport & Exercise Psychology,,
88,Quantitative,,Impact of Polygenic Risk Score for BMI and Negative Life Experiences on Binge Eating Behaviours in Adolescents from the CogBIAS Study,"Existing research has established that both negative life experiences and genetic predisposition are positively associated with binge eating behaviour. However, the interaction between these variables has undergone far less investigation. Gene-environment interactions are being increasingly studied for their predictive abilities of different forms of psychopathology, including disordered eating. Binge eating is widely accepted as being polygenic in nature, however, a Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) for this trait has not yet been finalised. Instead, studies have linked binge eating and other disordered eating behaviours most closely with the PRS for BMI. A PRS quantifies an individual’s genetic predisposition by summing the effects of multiple genetic variants. This study sought to analyse data from the CogBIAS study in order to examine both the independent and interactive effects of the PRS for BMI and negative life events measured on The Child Adolescent Survey of Experiences. The effects were investigated through the outcome variable binge eating measured by the three subscales emotional eating, uncontrolled eating and cognitive restraint of The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were employed for each of the subscale outcomes, identifying only one significant predictor being the interaction effect between BMI-PRS and negative life events for emotional eating. However, after applying the false discovery rate correction for multiple testing, this result no longer met the significance threshold. This study highlights the importance of accurate gene-environment interaction modelling. Further research is needed to draw definitive conclusions regarding the role of polygenic gene-environment effects in the etiology of binge eating.

However, findings of its effect are inconsistent when applied to the social media context. People have shown limited sensitivity to the diversity of authors and reasons. Nonetheless, researchers have found that showing consensus quality explicitly to people can improve their sensitivity to the diversity aspect of consensus. Therefore, in this 2 (authors: non-diverse versus diverse) x 2 (reasons: same versus distinct) factorial design study, we investigate people's sensitivity to diverse evidence (authors and reasons) in messages and the impact of this diversity on perceived persuasiveness and belief revision. Participants will be shown a diagram summarising diversity of the evidence supporting two opposing sides of an argument about a given claim. Participants first rate their prior agreement with a claim and then update their agreement after viewing the diagram. We conduct binomial tests to determine whether participants identify evidence with higher diversity (e.g., diversity in both authors and reasons) as more persuasive than low diversity (e.g., diversity in either only authors or only reasons). To test whether participants update their beliefs consistent with the type of evidence they identified as more convincing, we conduct one-sample t-tests on the prior-to-posterior shifts in agreement ratings for each kind of diagram.",Cognitive Psychology,,
90,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Australian Parents' Experiences in Navigating Children's Craniosynostosis Diagnosis: A Qualitative Study,"Receiving a craniosynostosis diagnosis in childhood significantly impacts both the child and their parents. The urgency for early surgical interventions often leads to a challenging diagnostic journey for parents. Previous research has revealed a wide range of struggles faced by these parents including a lack of information and medical support from healthcare practitioners, contending with inaccurate information online, which are exacerbated by a lack of prior knowledge, and significant emotional distress amidst uncertainty. Despite the growing literature surrounding craniosynostosis, there remains a lack of focused understanding of the diagnosis period, particularly within the Australian context. This qualitative study explores Australian parents’ experiences in navigating their children’s craniosynostosis diagnosis. Using reflexive thematic analysis on interview data from 17 participants, five key themes were identified: (1) Support from healthcare practitioners; (2) Disparity in information access; (3) Emotional turmoil; (4) Navigating adversity post diagnosis; and (5) Emotional resilience. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of caring for children with a craniosynostosis diagnosis in an Australian context, providing insights that may contribute to improve and inform the support provided to parents through a challenging and critical time.

91,Meta-Analysis,,Psychosocial Safety Climate as a meta-analytic framework for organisational stress intervention evaluation,"Occupational stress theories predict that organisational stress interventions will be more effective than individual interventions in reducing workplace stress. This current meta-analysis examined the efficacy of existing organisational stress interventions through the lens of the psychosocial safety climate framework. A systematic search of electronic databases between 2000 and 2024 identified 58 studies (N = 28,536) with organisational stress interventions targeting four domains of the psychosocial safety climate framework (job demands, job resources, motivation and psychological health symptoms). Meta-analytic results indicated that organisational stress interventions were effective in reducing employee’s psychological health symptoms (d = -.15, p <.05). Organisational stress interventions did show effects in the direction of interest for the other three PSC elements although these relationships were not significant (motivation d  = .04, p > 0.05; job resources d  = .11, p >.05; job demands d  = -.22, p >.05). Intervention length did not significantly change the intervention results. Fundamentally, the current review investigated the impact of organisational stress interventions on improved psychosocial working practices, motivational and psychological health symptoms through the lens of the PSC theoretical framework. These initial results show that organisational stress interventions improve workplace psychological health symptoms and highlight the potential need for a paradigm shift in the design and implementation of organisational stress intervention from symptom based interventions to those centred around creating healthy psychosocial working environments.

AI has been found to have a positive effect on efficiency, safety and quality of processes. As the utilisation of AI increases, exploration of the impacts of such use on the wellbeing of individuals is pivotal. Social Baseline Theory proposes that humans assume proximity to and availability of social resources which act as bioenergetic resources. Personality, specifically extraversion, is believed to be one factor contributing to the variation in social baselines between individuals. When individuals are below their social baseline, or alone, certain compensatory neural, cognitive and behavioural actions occur to compensate for this deficit, such as increased glucose consumption. AI use has been found in some studies to correlate with a decrease in loneliness levels however it has also been associated with negative social outcomes. Prior studies have investigated the relationship between AI use and some facets of wellbeing, however a specific investigation on the relationship between AI use and extraversion, loneliness and sugar intake are lacking, and as such, is the focus of this study. Participant responses were collected using a survey with a between-subjects design. It was hypothesised that there will be a relationship between (1) AI use and loneliness and (2) AI use and sugar intake, both relationships will be moderated by level of extraversion. It was also hypothesised that (3) loneliness will be positively correlated with sugar intake, regardless of level of extraversion. ",Health Psychology,Social Psychology,

These burdens often lead to caregiver burnout, substantially impact well-being. Music therapy (MT) has emerged as a beneficial intervention for FCGs, offering emotional support and improving the quality of care provided to PWD. MT is a professional practice where trained music therapists use musical elements to enhance health, well-being, and quality of life across various settings. Qualitative studies have highlighted the benefits of MT interventions such as therapeutic songwriting and group singing for reducing stress, improving communication, and fostering stronger connections between FCGs and PWD. However, there has been a lack of comprehensive reviews examining the impacts of only MT interventions on FCGs. To address this gap, a mixed-methods review was conducted, systematically searching eight online databases and retrieving 19 studies. From these studies, three key findings emerged: the impact of MT on caregiver mental well-being, social well-being, and caregiver perceptions of MT's benefits. Findings indicate that MT interventions can enhance the quality of life, mental health, and social connections for FCGs, improving relationships between PWD and FCGs. Additionally, the review identified benefits and limitations specific to MT interventions, highlighting the importance of these interventions for supporting FCG well-being and establishing improvements needed to make the interventions more effective. Overall, this review is among the first to consolidate the findings of MT's impact on FCGs, suggesting substantial benefits for this population.

94,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Maintaining wellbeing through music: Exploring the role of music in the Bangladeshi community in Australia,"Bangladeshi-born immigrants make up a small, relatively new community in Australia. Approximately 51,491 Bangladeshi people reside in Australia, 67% of whom are Australian Citizens. In the last decade, a 48% increase has been observed in the immigration of Bangladeshis to Australia. Despite this community’s progress in Australian society, there remains a large gap in the literature concerning the health and positive wellbeing of Bangladeshis, particularly about their experiences of resettlement in Australia. Music is a key marker of culture and is often associated with wellbeing. Given this, it is likely that music plays a key role in helping to maintain positive wellbeing within communities post-immigration. The proposed study aimed to explore the role of music in the Bangladeshi community in Australia, how music is used in the community (for example, at rites of passage or celebrations), and whether music is perceived to affect wellbeing and if so why. Nine Bangladeshi community leaders aged 30-59 living in South Australia (n = 8) and Victoria (n = 1) were recruited through purposive sampling by utilising social media to circulate the study fliers, and participated in semi-structured interviews, which will be subsequently analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.

Looking at the Occurrence and Consequences of Interpersonal Bracing,"According to folk wisdom, if you “brace for the worst, you won’t be disappointed”. But evidence suggests this emotion regulation strategy may do more harm than good (Kalokerinos et al., 2022). We know that people brace themselves for the worst, and that doing so can have negative outcomes. Here, we wondered, do people also brace others for the worst? In this thesis, we investigate the existence and consequences of interpersonal bracing: an act of lowering another person’s expectations to reduce the emotional impact that a potentially negative outcome might have. The main aims are to see (1) whether people engage in interpersonal bracing and (2) how interpersonal bracing is received. In Study 1, we asked 81 participants to imagine that the person they are closest to was in a stressful situation with an uncertain outcome (e.g., awaiting biopsy results), and write them a message of support. We coded these messages for the presence of interpersonal bracing and found that bracing occurred on 41% of occasions. In Study 2, we will ask 200 participants to imagine that they are in a stressful situation with an uncertain outcome. We will give participants a message that, hypothetically, is from the person they are closest to. The message will contain either interpersonal bracing or no-bracing; we will test whether emotional reactions and cognitive expectations vary by bracing condition.

Although physical risk factors contributing to PRMD have been well-documented, the psychological aspects of pain in musicians remain underexplored. This study aims to investigate the applicability of the Fear Avoidance Model (FAM), a well-established framework in pain literature, to musicians experiencing playing-related pain. Specifically, the research will examine how pain catastrophizing and fear of movement contribute to decreased musician functional ability and negative mood, beyond the effects of pain intensity and demographic variables.

A cross-sectional survey design was employed to collect data from a convenience sample of musicians aged 18-65 who experience playing-related pain. Participants completed an online questionnaire assessing pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, mood, and musical identity. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis will be conducted to explore the unique contributions of psychological factors to functional ability and mood, while controlling for demographic variables and pain intensity.

This study seeks to provide new insights into the psychological mechanisms underlying pain in musicians and may inform more effective strategies for managing playing-related pain.

Parents of children undergoing surgery often experience psychological distress and have unique support needs (Pomicino et al., 2018). The aim of the present study is to explore parents’ experiences and perceived support across the perioperative period. 16 semi-structured interviews with 17 Australian parents were selected from a pre-existing dataset for analysis. Reflexive thematic analysis, conducted with an inductive and social-constructionist approach, generated five key themes. These included (1) the advocate, (2) travelling the ‘right’ route, (3) just getting through it, (4) adjusting to the child’s new appearance, and (5) more than ‘just a number’. Analysis highlighted the complexity of parents' emotional experiences and aspects of care where parents require further support. Findings demonstrated the value of providing all parents with psychological supports and the need for care to be reactive to the emotional needs of families.

98,Quantitative,,Investigating the Accuracy of Outcome Predictions and Negative Affect Forecasts in Uncertain Scenarios,"The ability to make accurate predictions is essential for decision making and planning. Such decisions are guided not only by how people think a situation will go (their outcome forecast), but also how they expect to feel (their affective forecast). But are these outcome and affective forecasts accurate? In this thesis, we explore the accuracy of outcome and affective forecasts for personally relevant uncertain situations, such as awaiting medical test results. We focus on this context because waiting for uncertain outcomes is a unique stressor that leads to high levels of anxiety and worry. Anxiety symptoms are often associated with stronger emotional reactions and decision making impairments. Thus, we also examined whether anxiety moderates the accuracy of outcome and affective forecasts. We used pre-existing data from a longitudinal study that followed people while they awaited the outcome of an uncertain situation. Participants (N=160) completed a baseline survey, where they rated their anxiety symptoms and forecasted the likelihood of best and worst case outcomes, and how they would feel if the best and worst case occurred. In follow up surveys, participants indicated whether they knew the outcome of the situation, how close the outcome was to the best or worst case, and how they felt when they received the outcome. Preliminary data analyses suggest participants tend to be pessimistic in their outcome and affective forecasts: for example, participants anticipated worse outcomes then what actually occurred (d = .44,  p <.001).

99,Meta-Synthesis,,"Mind and Metabolism—exploring lived experiences of and perspectives toward coexisting dementia and diabetes among individuals living with the conditions, family caregivers, and healthcare professionals: a systematic review and meta-synthesis","Dementia and diabetes mellitus (DM) are complex, chronic and progressive conditions that often coexist in older adults. Evidence suggests that people living with dementia (PLWD) may find it challenging to adhere to stringent DM care regimes, placing a unique burden on family caregivers who therefore assume extensive care responsibilities, and presenting challenges for healthcare professionals who must provide tailored and dementia-aware DM care. Despite the growing recognition of the complex interplay between dementia and DM, the lived experiences of those affected remain relatively unclear. Guided by JBI collaboration methods, a systematic review and meta-synthesis of 15 peer-reviewed qualitative studies was conducted. Meta-aggregation yielded four synthesised findings: (1) Impact of dementia on engagement with and accessibility of DM care, (2) Caregivers’ role, responsibilities and challenges, (3) Person-centred DM decision-making and care provision, and (4) Training and technology for dementia-aware DM care. The findings offer insights into the complex nature of DM management in the context of dementia. Memory impairment, as well as the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, made self-management of DM challenging, if not untenable. Thus, caregivers were often responsible for facilitating DM care and reported feeling overwhelmed by, and ill-equipped to manage, the numerous demands associated with the complex care needs of their loved ones. Such challenges were exacerbated by healthcare systems that were not dementia-aware or lacked continuity. As such, integrated, person-centred clinical decision-making and healthcare, that actively considers the unique and dynamic needs of PLWD, is necessary for the effective management of coexisting dementia and DM. To facilitate such care, it is recommended that more rigorous interdisciplinary training of healthcare professionals, as well as more dementia-aware assistive DM technology, are implemented. Future research priorities are also evident. Studies included in this review were primarily conducted in high-income, Western cultures, thus cross-cultural explorations in this clinical context are recommended. Furthermore, given participants were mostly caregivers and healthcare professionals, researchers should carefully consider how those living with dementia and DM can be actively involved in research to faithfully represent the voices of those most closely affected by this complex comorbidity.",Health Psychology,Public Health,Clinical Psychology
100,Meta-Analysis,,The effectiveness of verbal fluency tests for detecting cognitive decline in adults with Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia: A meta-analysis,"With the global aging population, the prevalence of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is increasing. Although no cure exists, early detection and intervention are crucial in managing symptoms and extending life expectancy. Specific diagnoses, such as behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), facilitate tailored treatment and planning. Verbal fluency tests, including the FAS letter and Animal category fluency tests, are effective for detecting FTD due to their reliance on frontal lobe functioning. However, a comprehensive review of their effectiveness in detecting AD and FTD has yet to be collated. A systematic search of five databases identified 127 peer-reviewed studies published from 2010 onward, comparing AD and FTD patients to cognitively-healthy controls. The overall effectiveness (dementia combined) for fluency scores (g = -1.82), AD and FTD types and FTD subtypes were calculated using Hedges’ g.  The influence of study risk-of-bias (RoB), age, education, disease duration and publication bias were also investigated.  The FAS and Animal fluency total scores effectively detected cognitive decline in AD and FTD (combined), indicated by large negative Hedges’ g effect sizes (g = -1.39 and g = -2.01, respectively). Small effects were seen for Animal set-loss and perseveration (g = -0.02 and g = -0.07, respectively).  The pattern of effects remained consistent when only low-risk-of-bias studies were analysed, however, significant publication bias was indicated for AD. Overall, the FAS and Animal fluency test total scores effectively detect cognitive decline in AD and FTD, although bvFTD may not perform disproportionately worse than AD.",Clinical Neuropsychology,,
101,Quantitative,,Own-Race Bias effects on Unfamiliar Face Recognition: implications for changing facial features,"Face perception plays as a vital cognitive function, essential for social interactions, technological advancements and eyewitness identification. However, face recognition has proven to be error-prone, influenced by biases, individual differences and variations in facial features. Existing literature has provided evidence that intergroup biases are present in facial recognition, yet limited research has investigated the correlation between own-race bias and facial occlusions on recognition.  This study addressed the gap by examining the Own-Race bias (ORB) effect on unfamiliar face recognition, and its implications for varying facial characteristics. Using an online image sorting task, participants (N=133) across racial groups sorted arrays of 20 images across 16 trials including black and white male faces, varying beardedness and clean-shaven. A 3x2 within-subjects design was employed, exploring congruent (beard-beard/clean-clean) and incongruent (e.g. beard-clean) conditions to determine how changes in race, facial features and congruency effects impact recognition accuracy.

We hypothesised a pronounced ORB effect, with lower accuracy in recognizing outgroup faces compared to ingroup faces. Reflecting previous studies, it was anticipated that congruent conditions would result in higher accuracy than incongruent conditions. The findings contribute to existing research on face perception, offering insights into the complex interplay between race and facial recognition. This study has significant implications for enhancing security and errors within the criminal justice systems, particularly in multicultural societies where accurate cross-racial face recognition is crucial. These insights underline the continued need for exploration of how facial feature variations affect the recognition of unfamiliar faces in diverse populations.

102,Qualitative,Qualitative Content Analysis,Shedding light on perceptions of photobiomodulation therapy: A qualitative content analysis of subreddit posts,"Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMt), or low-level laser therapy, is a non-invasive medical treatment, whereby red and near infrared light is administered to irradiate human tissue with low-power lasers or light-emitting diodes to promote healing.  There is increasing interest in the therapeutic benefits and potential clinical applications of PBMt. However, there is a lack of research exploring patient perceptions and experiences of PBMt in the treatment of health conditions.  This project aims to explore posts from a forum dedicated to PBMt, to gain insight into perceptions and experiences of PBMt as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of health conditions.  A systematic search was conducted and a Reddit subreddit was selected for analysis, as it was the largest public discussion forum dedicated to PBMt.  A sample of the most recent posts and comments (i.e., threads) were extracted using a Python-based script via Reddit’s application programming interface wrapper and manually.  Threads were screened for eligibility and a conventional qualitative content analysis was conducted on threads meeting the inclusion criteria.  Of the 999 threads that were collected from the subreddit, 427 were excluded, resulting in 572 threads authored by 1114 participants that were included in the analysis.  Results of the analysis found five overarching categories: participant motivations for use of the PBMt subreddit, PBMt device information, PBMt treatment information, health concerns and PBMt effects, and psychological perceptions of PBMt.  Findings provide insight into forum members’ diverse perceptions, experiences and challenges regarding PBMt, including barriers to accessing evidence-based information and treatment.  Further research, including large clinical trials are needed to determine and establish clinical protocol parameters and guidelines, regarding efficacy and safety of focused PBMt treatment interventions, for a broad range of health conditions.

103,Quantitative,,"Exploring the Relationships Between Self-Control, Mindfulness, and Symptoms of Problematic Social Media Use","The impact of social media platforms on their users is widely debated in scientific literature. However, it is clear that some users excessively engage with social media despite experiencing negative consequences, a pattern of behaviour known as problematic social media use (Shannon et al., 2022). Studies indicate that higher trait self-control may assist with mitigating symptoms of problematic social media use (Zahrai, Veer, Ballantine, & Peter de Vries, 2022), while trait mindfulness theoretically improves self-control (Bowlin & Baer, 2012; Teper et al., 2013). Self-control and mindfulness have been positively associated with each other, and negatively associated with problematic social media use (Meynadier et al., 2024; Sagar, 2021). Research is yet to explore these variables in a cohesive study, and the present study aimed to fill this gap by examining whether self-control mediates the relationship between mindfulness and problematic social media use. A cross-sectional study was conducted, with data being gathered from an online survey. Participants (N = 202) were over the age of 18, currently working, and residing in Australia.

104,Quantitative,,Understanding Attitudes Towards AI: Personality and AI Usage as Predictors of Attitudes Towards AI,"Within recent years, the importance and ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased dramatically, being incorporated into many different technologies including smart devices, social media platforms, and global logistics systems. However, despite its growing prevalence, much remains unknown as to the attitudes people hold towards AI and the factors which shape them. This study aims to address this by examining the effect of personality and AI usage on attitudes towards AI. While personality as a predictor AI-related attitudes has been examined previously, results are largely inconclusive and predominantly look at highly specific forms of AI such as physically embodied AI, rather than AI as a general concept. As such, this study aims to examine the effect of the Big Five Personality Traits on attitudes towards AI, employing the ATTARI-12 to capture attitudes towards AI as a single, general construct. Secondarily, this study will examine the correlation between participants usage of various generative AI tools, and their accompanying AI-related attitudes. Finally, this study will examine the effect of various demographic variables including age and gender on attitudes towards AI. Given that research has consistently shown attitudes to be a strong predictor of whether or not consumers actually use a particular technology, it is likely that understanding differences in attitudes towards AI and what factors may account for said differences will play a crucial role in determining the successful or unsuccessful uptake and integration of AI technologies.",Cyberpsychology,Personality Psychology,Human Factors
105,Quantitative,,White Matter Tract Integrity in Sub-Clinical Autism: The Influence of Co-occurring Anxiety,"Many studies have investigated the white matter (WM) integrity of those with autism, with most studies observing weakened tract integrity throughout the brain. However, few studies have investigated the impact that comorbid traits have on WM integrity in autism. As comorbid conditions such as anxiety are commonplace in those diagnosed with autism, this is a concerning gap in the literature. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between autistic traits and anxiety traits in WM tracts within the adult subclinical population. Based on previous literature, we hypothesised that anxiety traits would predict weakened WM in the stria terminalis, autistic traits would predict weakened WM in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and an interaction between both traits would be observed in the uncinate fasciculus. We collected MRI diffusion data from a subclinical sample (N = 78) of a larger study and analysed the data with the FMRIB software library (FSL) using a whole-brain, voxel-based analysis and tract based spatial statistics (TBSS). We did not find an interaction between anxious and autistic traits in any WM tracts, nor did anxious traits predict any WM aberrance. However, autistic traits predicted WM aberrance in the SLF and posterior thalamic radiation, but these results were narrowly non-significant. These findings suggest that other factors, such as social or environmental, play a larger role in co-occurring anxiety in autism than white matter integrity. Furthermore, these findings highlight areas for future research, including more specific analysis on the SLF, to better understand its role in subclinical autistic traits.

106,Quantitative,,Day-to-Day Variations in Psychological Flexibility: Assessing Response to Daily Stressors in Athlete Populations,"Psychological fitness is a primary determinant in athlete success. A growing body of literature indicates that the ability to endure distress while pursuing personally meaningful goals is one psychological factor associated with greater athletic performance. This construct is referred to as psychological flexibility (PF). While PF is largely explored as a fixed trait, some academics argue that it also exists as a dynamic state. Understanding the variability of PF in athletes is crucial to correctly interpreting measures and implementing meaningful interventions. The present study utilised a sample of Australian athletes (n = 22) performing at various levels of competition (non-elite, sub-elite, and elite). Using an ecological momentary design, participants responded to daily online measures of PF, sport-confidence and momentary stress for 7 days. It was hypothesised that more elite athletes would demonstrate greater PF and day-to-day stability of PF. Moreover, it was hypothesised that day-to-day variability of PF would bear significant associations with other known state-like predictors of athletic performance. Namely, sport-confidence and stress. Preliminary results tentatively indicate there were significant differences in mean PF scores between non-elite athletes and their sub-elite and elite counterparts. Moreover, more elite athletes may demonstrate greater stability in certain facets of PF. Specifically, Harnessing. Total PF scores may also predict variability of momentary stress. Collectively, these insights indicate that interventions aimed at enhancing total PF scores and the stability of Harnessing scores could improve athletic performance. Additionally, improving PF in athletes may mitigate stress reactivity, an important correlate of athletic success. ",Sport & Exercise Psychology,,
107,Mixed-Methods ,Content Analysis,The Role of Gender and Animal Species on the Experience and Resolution of Meat-Related Cognitive Dissonance: A Study of Meat-Eating,"The meat paradox encompasses the phenomenon that we simultaneously express moral concern and care for animals, yet also condone the intensive farming and slaughter of animals to eat meat. The meat-related cognitive dissonance framework (Rothgerber, 2020) proposes that this discrepancy between our beliefs and behaviors generates aversive arousal which individuals are subsequently motivated to reduce.  This present study aims to investigate how individual differences and the source of animal meat differentially impacts how individuals experience and resolve this dissonance. Specifically, it was hypothesized that men strongly identifying with traditional gender roles and individuals high in speciesism would express less dissonance, more direct meat-eating justifications, and less intention to reduce meat consumption. Additionally, when considered as the origin of meat, pigs in comparison to chickens were predicted to be more effective in eliciting cognitive dissonance and behavioral reduction. A 2 (men, women) x 3 (chicken, pig, control) between-subjects experimental design was employed, with animal species and gender constituting the independent variables. Generalized linear mixed modelling interpreted findings, with pre- and post-negative affect, meat-eating justifications, and behavior change intention measured as dependent variables, and gender-role orientation and speciesism added as covariates. Content analysis on qualitative responses rationalizing continued meat consumption will also be conducted to enrich and validate meat-eating justifications captured on existing scales. This study will illuminate insight onto the applications of cognitive dissonance theory in tailoring interventions to effectively optimize behavior change in targeted populations, with significant positive implications on animal welfare, human health, and environmental sustainability.

108,Quantitative,,Psychosocial Safety Climate and Passion: The Mediating role of Human Resource Management Policies,"Workplace contextual causes of passion at work are not clearly understood. Drawing on the dualistic model of passion theory, this longitudinal study investigated how the organisational psychosocial safety climate (PSC), the climate for the protection of psychological health and safety, and organisational human resource management practices influenced subsequent individual employee harmonious passion (a healthy, balanced engagement with work) and obsessive passion (a pressure-driven, uncontrollable engagement). Matched data were collected from 39 Australian universities across two waves (N = 2,876 employees). Both individual and multilevel statistical modelling were completed. Results showed that organisational PSC was positively related to organisational human resource practices and individual harmonious passion. Organisational PSC and human resource practices were negatively related to individual obsessive passion. At the individual level, human resource practices also mediated the relationship between PSC and harmonious passion. This research aims to provide both theoretical and practical insights into how organisational contexts and support systems can cultivate beneficial forms of passion while mitigating the risks associated with obsessive passion. The findings offer valuable implications for human resource management policy development and organisational practices in the context of university work environments, ultimately guiding efforts to enhance employee well-being and productivity.",Organisational Psychology,Positive Psychology,Applied Psychology
109,Quantitative,,"Evaluating the credibility of scientific press releases: the role of critical thinking, science literacy, and science reasoning skills","In the current digital landscape, the internet provides vast amounts of information to the public instantly and more people are obtaining their news from online sources. However, due to the rise of fake news and misinformation, it has become increasingly important to be able to evaluate online news effectively. Prior research highlights the challenges posed by cognitive heuristics and misinformation, with studies showing that critical thinking significantly influences belief in false news whereas scientific literacy influences how people evaluate scientific claims. This study extends these findings to scientific information in press releases, a common medium for publicising scientific discoveries.  We predict that critical thinking, science literacy, and science reasoning skills will be correlated with perceived source and message credibility and participants higher in these factors will be able to more effectively identify the highly credible press releases.  An online observational study was conducted with participants who evaluated eight mock press releases – four high in credibility based on Mertonian Norms (expertise, reputable institution, peer review, and open data), and four lower in credibility. Participants were subjected to measures of message and source credibility for each press release and also measures of critical thinking, science literacy, and science reasoning skills. A correlation matrix and multiple regressions with the measures of credibility, critical thinking, science literacy, and science reasoning skills will be conducted. This research contributes to the literature on science communication and has practical implications for the development of educational interventions aimed at enhancing public understanding of scientific claims in online news.",Cognitive Psychology,,
110,Quantitative,,Forgiveness and mental health: exploring moderating effects within a representative sample of Australian children and adolescents,"Dispositional interpersonal and self-forgiveness are adaptive traits that promote positive relational and psychological outcomes. Psychoeducation interventions focused on interpersonal forgiveness are associated with decreased anger and psychopathology, and increased hope and life satisfaction in school students. Remarkably little is known, however, about the development and correlates of self-forgiveness in youth populations. This aim of this study was to investigate relationships between dispositional interpersonal and self-forgiveness and mental health outcomes, within a large, representative dataset of Australian school students (N=79,670; aged 7 to 18 years). I explored the moderating effects of gender, age and level of school engagement, to increase knowledge of student demographics who may particularly benefit from forgiveness promotion. This study applied a correlational design to the aggregated Australian Resilient Youth Survey dataset via a series of moderated regressions. I operationalised mental health through the dual-continuum model, considering psychological wellbeing (global life satisfaction and hope), and psychological distress (externalising symptoms). Analyses revealed moderating effects of age, gender and school engagement upon the relationship between self-forgiveness and psychological distress. All other regressions reported negligible moderation effect sizes, suggesting little practical relevance of these moderators upon the forgiveness-mental health association. I discuss the practical implications of these findings, particularly for schools and youth organisations considering program design and demographic targeting for forgiveness psychoeducation programs. I also reflect on the theoretical implications following this early exploration of child self-forgiveness, and consider future avenues for research, including developmental studies, and discerning genuine self-forgiveness in younger children.",Individual Differences,Positive Psychology,Developmental Psychology
111,Quantitative,,Investigating the Impact of Mental Health Stigma on Juror Decision-Making,"The societal implications of mental health stigma in the criminal justice system are profound, manifesting through negative stereotypes that perpetuate discrimination and hinder fair legal proceedings. Defendants with mental health disorders, often victims of violence opposed to perpetrators face significant stigma. The diversity of how varying mental health disorders are stigmatised by jurors is under explored. The current study investigated how exposure to stigmatising language in criminal trials influence juror’s decision-making towards defendants diagnosed with schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The study employed a 3 (mental health condition: major depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia) × 2 (stigma: presence of a mental health condition, absence of a mental health condition) mixed between-within experimental design. Participants were asked to assign a level of guilt, answered questions in regard to their perceptions of the defendant and their perceived social distance and dangerousness (public stigma) of the defendant described in each scenario. 120 participants read case scenarios and made decisions based on assigning a level of guilt, providing their perceptions of the defendant and public stigma (i.e., social distance and perceived dangerousness). The findings partially supported the predictions. Participants assigned more guilt and perceived defendants with mental health conditions (MHC) as more dangerous. However, differences in verdicts across specific MHCs were not significant. The results also showed greater knowledge of mental health disorders and familiarity with concepts of psychology, law, and criminology partially influenced leniency in verdict ratings and perceptions of dangerousness.

112,Quantitative,,The impact of masculinity stress on facial emotion recognition in men,"A man’s experience of masculinity stress has been linked to aggressive thoughts and behaviours. There are many precursors that may lead men who experience masculinity stress to behave aggressively. This includes a person’s hostile attribution of neutral stimuli. The present study investigated how the experience of masculinity stress or masculinity assurance impacts males’ ability to accurately identify happy, neutral, and angry facial emotions. Based on previous literature, it was hypothesised that men who experienced masculinity stress misattributed happy and neutral facial expressions as angry, with this inaccuracy being more common when the participants viewed male faces. During the online study, participants completed a self-report questionnaire, then were randomly assigned to the two masculinity conditions. These conditions were distributed through the participants being provided with ostensible feedback that provoked an experience of masculinity stress or masculinity assurance. Participants then completed a graded facial emotion recognition task in which their misattribution of happy and neutral expressed were analysed. The desired sample size was 199 participants, evenly separated between a student sample and adult general population sample, as collected using digital and physical study advertisement distribution. Statistical analysis is planned to be conducted using a Two Way Analysis of Variance. If the study’s hypothesis is true, the discussion will identify that this research contributes to developing a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that cause masculinity stressed men to interpret ambiguous situations as hostile. This development will direct future research to focus on the early cognitive mechanisms that cause men to behave aggressively in ambiguous situations.",Cognitive Psychology,Personality Psychology,Social Psychology

Given the limited ecological validity of such static expressions, this study aims to examine how familiarity with a face might influence the perception of authentic, dynamic emotional expressions and associated eye gaze patterns. Given that genuine expressions often exhibit greater variation and subtlety than posed expressions, this allows us to assess whether familiarity has a more pronounced influence when interpreting more ambiguous emotional cues. Genuine emotion expressions were judged for emotional valence, arousal, and emotion category by up to 54 participants. Data collection is still in progress. This study aims to investigate three research questions. Firstly, does familiarity improve recognition accuracy of emotion category, valence and arousal? Secondly, does eye gaze alter with increased familiarity? Thirdly, is there a relationship between eye gaze and emotion perception accuracy? It is hypothesised that (1) Familiarity will have a non-significant effect on perception accuracy of emotion category (2) Familiarity will have a significant effect on accuracy of emotion valence and arousal perception (3) Gaze in the eye region gaze will increase with familiarity (4) Accuracy of arousal and valence perception will be positively correlated with eye gaze in the eye region.

Yet, research suggests trigger warnings are ineffective in helping people avoid negative content or mitigating emotional reactions to such content (Bridgland et al., 2023). What remains unclear is whether the type of trigger warning matters. Here, we compare the effects of two types of warnings—content focused warnings (e.g., Trigger warning: the following video depicts a serious road accident) and emotion focused warnings (e.g., Trigger warning: the following content may be distressing)—on avoidance of and emotional reactions to negative content. We recruited 374 Prolific participants who viewed either a content-focused or an emotion-focused trigger warning. After viewing the trigger warning, participants were asked if they would like to avoid watching the video they were warned about. Those who avoided watched a neutral video and those who did not avoid watched one of two negative videos (depicting a serious road accident or stillbirth). Participants rated their emotions immediately after the trigger warning, halfway through the video, and after the video. Based on negative priming literature, we expect that participants in the emotion-focused condition will anticipate higher levels of negative emotion than participants in the content-focused condition and therefore, be more likely to avoid watching the video. Our findings will underpin future guidelines for the use and wording of trigger warnings.",Social Psychology,Individual Differences,Applied Psychology

The current research aims to maximise the wellbeing of adolescent musicians by examining the effects of communication between ensemble music directors and student musicians. The work utilises motivational climate theory and examines the way a learning environment may satisfy the basic needs of student musicians. Furthermore, this study investigates the impact of these factors on student wellbeing, as viewed from the eudaimonic activity model. It is hypothesised that increased empowering motivational climates will show a statistically significant association with increased psychological need satisfaction, and increased wellbeing, as measured by satisfaction with musical life and positive affect; Increased need satisfaction is also hypothesised to show a statistically significant association with increased wellbeing, above the contribution of demographic variables. Musician identity of the students will be assessed to assist in characterising this sample. A cross-sectional design with non-probability sampling methods was implemented. An online survey was distributed to the student musicians who participated in the 2024 Generations in Jazz Festival (N = 29), and their music directors as a separate sample for context purposes (N = 6). Hierarchical linear regression and correlation statistics will test the hypotheses.

Online communities, such as subreddits dedicated to endometriosis, provide a platform for individuals to share experiences and seek support. Analysing discussions on such platforms can offer insights into the needs and concerns of those with Endometriosis, potentially informing improvements in medical and public health practices.  Such analysis is particularly relevant given current efforts worldwide to improve Endometriosis awareness, research and care. This study used Qualitative Content Analysis to answer the question ""What do people on an endometriosis subreddit talk about?”. The data were 960 posts made during Endometriosis Awareness Month (March) 2024, consisting of both opening posts and comments on an Endometriosis-specific subreddit. This month was chosen due to its worldwide significance for Endometriosis research and the Endometriosis community, as well as being the month in which the Australian National Action Plan for Endometriosis (NAPE) was due for its 5 year review. Despite increasing international awareness of Endometriosis, many posts highlighted the ongoing struggle of those with symptoms of Endometriosis to be taken seriously, and receive diagnosis and treatment. The findings provide insight into many aspects of the ‘Endometriosis Journey’ and its impact on participants lives, with discussion ranging from relationships to pharmaceutical recommendations and beyond.

120,Quantitative,,Impact of Fear on Boundary Judgment Errors in Fearful vs. Neutral Images,"Boundary extension, a well-documented phenomenon in cognitive psychology, occurs when individuals recall scenes with wider boundaries than originally viewed, leading to memory distortions. This process is linked to the constructive nature of memory, where perceptual details are integrated with prior knowledge and emotions. Conversely, boundary restriction, where scene boundaries are recalled as narrower, is associated with high arousal or emotional stimuli, particularly negative emotions like fear. Although research has shown mixed results regarding the influence of emotional content on boundary errors, there is evidence suggesting that fear, as a high-arousal emotion, can distort spatial perception and potentially lead to boundary restriction. However, there is a notable gap in research specifically examining the impact of fear on boundary judgment errors in fear-inducing stimuli. This study seeks to fill that gap by investigating how generalized fear responses influence boundary extension and restriction in images depicting fear-inducing versus neutral stimuli. We hypothesize that higher global fear susceptibility will increase boundary restriction for fear-inducing images and reduce boundary extension. Existing data will be analyzed using Ordinal Logistic Regression to examine the relationship between boundary judgment errors, global fear susceptibility, and image type. The study aims to clarify the role of fear in boundary restriction and extend an understanding of how emotional states shape perceptual boundaries in memory.",Cognitive Psychology,Individual Differences,Perception
121,Quantitative,,Investigating the factors causing perceptions of moral decline,"Research has shown that people largely believe that morality is declining, despite empirical evidence proving otherwise. Although multiple theories have been suggested to explain this misguided perception, literature around perceptions of moral decline has yet to be supported by empirical research. Thus, this research aims to investigate the relationships between various factors that have been identified by current literature as contributing to perceptions of moral decline. This study hypothesizes that:
- Participants in the true headline condition will rate the headlines as more true than those in the 
  false headline condition.
- Participants will rate headlines they have been exposed to previously as more moral than 
  headlines they have not seen before.
- Participants in the true condition will see less moral decline in society compared to participants in 
  the false condition.
- Repeated exposure to victims will lead to increased victim blaming, and this effect will be 
  intensified by higher belief in just world scores.
- The individual difference variables of belief in a just world and political orientation will be explored 
  in relation to how they modify the above effects.
This study will utilize a within-between participants randomized trial. Participants will be collected through convenience sampling by handing out flyers in the University of Adelaide as well as social media recruitment. 131 participants were recruited in total. This research will have practical implications for media literacy and public policy, helping to foster a more informed and balanced public perception. Additionally, it has significant implications for research around allocation of limited resources. ",Social Psychology,,
122,Quantitative,,"Investigating personality, knowledge, and protective factor differences in people who invest in cryptocurrencies","Cryptocurrency is a digital asset based on blockchain technology that can be a form of investment or used as an exchange asset. Cryptocurrencies are traded on a 24/7 international online cryptocurrency market and can frequently experience rapid price changes, thus making it a much more volatile and speculative form of investment compared to conventional means of investing funds. While prior research has focused on differences between crypto and non-crypto investors, few studies examined how differences on a number of psychological factors affect the variance in cryptocurrency knowledge and experience in investors. This study recruited 294 current cryptocurrency traders and sought to identify the profile of cryptocurrency knowledge and experience, individual differences and risky trading practices associated with cryptocurrency trading. As hypothesised, cryptocurrency knowledge and experience were found to be negatively associated with personality variables such as impulsivity and anxiety. Financial management behaviour was found to be positively associated with both cryptocurrency knowledge and experience measures. Contrary to what was hypothesised, risky cryptocurrency trading practices were positively associated with protective factors in cryptocurrency trading. These findings give further insight into the knowledge and experience profile of cryptocurrency traders, along with respective individual differences, and highlight that the relationship between risk and protective behaviours is far from clear. Furthermore, these findings highlight the significance of experience as a mediating factor for both cryptocurrency knowledge and protective factors in cryptocurrency traders, thus suggesting an important avenue of development for further research.",Individual Differences,Learning & Behaviour,Behavioural Addictions
123,Meta-Analysis,Narrative Analysis,Effectiveness of mental health interventions for family medicine and general practice trainees: A systematic review with meta-analysis,"Background: Family medicine/general practice (FM/GP) trainees are increasingly recognised as at risk of occupational burnout, highlighting a need to examine which interventions are effective. Aims: To systematically review and quantitatively assess the empirical evidence for psychosocial interventions targeted to FM/GP trainees to reduce burnout and/or promote well-being. Methods: Eligible studies included FM/GP trainees undergoing psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing burnout/improving well-being. A large search on databases such as PsycInfo, Medline, Embase and ProQuest was performed without date restrictions. Studies were assessed by two reviewers for their risk of bias, using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) and achieved high inter-rater agreement (88%). Hedges' g effect size estimations were used to synthesise the data and pooled across trials using a random effects model. Publication bias was evaluated and causes of heterogeneity were investigated using moderator analyses. Results: Thirteen studies including 230 FM/GP trainees were included, with interventions focusing on organisational and individual levels. Individually based interventions showed a moderately large and statistically significant treatment effect (g = 0.483, 95% CI [0.096, 0.870], p <.05), however group differences were not observed. Qualitative feedback received from participants suggested interventions should focus on the importance of curriculum modifications and organised group support. Conclusions: Although some results displayed statistical significance, these results should be regarded cautiously because of the small sample sizes and possible bias. Overall, the findings of this study highlight the severity of burnout and its effects on well-being and the need for interventions to reduce these symptoms.

124,Qualitative,Framework Analysis,Patients' Explanatory Model of Breast Cancer: A Qualitative Exploration of Illness Explanation Among Chinese People living in Australia who Diagnosed with Breast Cancer,"This study explores the illness beliefs and perceptions of Chinese migrant women in Australia diagnosed with breast cancer, a group that is widely documented to experience worse psychological outcomes compared to the local population. Recognizing that the needs of patients from minority groups are distinctly different from those of the mainstream due to cultural beliefs and values, which significantly influence their healthcare practices, this research addresses the gap in culturally competent healthcare for ethnic minorities. Consistent evidence suggests that Chinese women, as a migrant ethnicity group, are at a heightened risk of poorer psychosocial outcomes, with culture being a prime factor in the persistence of health disparities. Despite this, culturally competent care has been underestimated in addressing these disparities. This study adopts an illness perception approach, focusing on the patient’s own model of their condition, beginning with their experience of illness. Textual data were collected from a Chinese online breast cancer support group, and a Framework Analysis was conducted, guided by Kleinman’s explanatory model of illness, to provide a culturally nuanced understanding of these patients' experiences and perceptions.",Health Psychology,,
125,Quantitative,,Testing Single versus Dual Processes in Reasoning using Base Rate Problems,"This study aims to investigate the mechanism behind base-rate bias in human reasoning and determine whether the single-process model of reasoning can be ruled out in favour of a dual-process model. Dual-process theory states that there are two distinct processes in reasoning, described as fast and slow. Type 1 is fast and relies on heuristic information, whereas Type 2 is considerably slower, involves higher order and logical thinking, and is generally more accurate. Single-process theory is similar but states that there is only one spectrum of reasoning, but it has a fast-heuristic end and a continuous progression to a slower and more deliberate end. Base-rate problems are a method of investigating this issue due to the concept of base-rate bias, which describes that individuals generally underweight the base-rate (statistical information) compared to the stereotype information. Dual-process theory explains this by the inactivity of Type 2 thinking leaving Type 1 to rely on the stereotype information and heuristics that align with it. Previous studies have concluded in support of the dual-process model. However, these studies do not completely rule out the possibility of a single-process model. Signed difference analysis (SDA) is a method of analysis that is capable of statistically ruling out the single-process model, through the results giving a ‘forbidden pattern’ that could only be explained by a Dual-process model.

126,Qualitative,Thematic Analysis,Medicalisation and Beyond: Navigating Patient Experiences and Provider Perspectives in Australian Gender-Affirming Care,"The number of individuals identifying as transgender or gender-diverse (TGD) continues to grow exponentially, resulting in increased demands for appropriate gender-affirming healthcare worldwide. While the healthcare and medical industry has evolved to try and adapt to these needs, studies have reported that TGD individuals continue to be at greater risk of experiencing negative healthcare experiences and poor health outcomes. Further, there remains a lack of empirical research examining the complex experiences of individuals navigating medical treatments related to gender identity affirmation, particularly within an Australian context. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring both patient and provider perspectives and conducting interviews with 7 healthcare providers and 60 TGD individuals. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted within a critical realist framework to generate four themes: Barriers and Challenges to Accessing Care; Patient Experiences and Professional Growth; Balancing Healthcare Approaches with Patient Needs; and The Gender Binary and Gatekeeping: Informed Consent vs Diagnoses. Findings illustrated how the medicalisation of gender-affirming care and Western binary frameworks of gender create access barriers for TGD individuals, particularly those who are neurodivergent or non-binary. Further, healthcare providers reported struggling to balance patient needs while considering medico-legal issues, resulting in medical gatekeeping practices. These findings illustrate a need for flexible, inclusive healthcare practices that acknowledge the diversity of TGD experiences. Increased education for healthcare providers and a shift towards using informed consent approaches that empower patient autonomy is suggested to promote the wellbeing of TGD individuals.",Social Psychology,Health Psychology,
